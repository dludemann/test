        applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court
        order, or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a
        subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national

  <section>
    <h3>4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as
      necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless
      otherwise required by law.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary
      for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention
      period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other
      legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us to keep
      your personal information for longer than 2 years.
    </p>

    <p>
      When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
      information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not
      possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored
      in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information
      and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information
      through a system of organizational and technical security measures.
    </p>

    <p>
      We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security
      measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
      process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the
      internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect
      your personal information, transmission of personal information to and
      from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the services
      within a secure environment.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>6. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or market
      to children under 18 years of age.
    </p>

    <p>
      We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years
      of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or
      that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such
      minor dependent's use of the Services. If we learn that personal
      information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we
      will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
      delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we have
      collected from children under age 18, please contact us at
      info@thematchartist.com.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>In Short:</strong> You may review, change, or terminate your
      account at any time.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are a resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are

      to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can
      find their contact details here:
      <a
        href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm"

      >.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>8. DATA BREACH</h3>
    <p>
      A privacy breach occurs when there is unauthorized access to or
      collection, use, disclosure or disposal of personal information. You will
      be notified about data breaches when The Match Arist believes you are
      likely to be at risk or serious harm. For example, a data breach may be
      likely to result in serious financial harm or harm to your mental or
      physical well-being. In the event that he Match Arist becomes aware of a
      security breach which has resulted or may result in unauthorized access,
      use or disclosure of personal information, The Match Arist will promptly
      investigate the matter and notify the applicable Supervisory Authority not
      later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, unless the personal
      data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of
      natural persons.

  <section>
    <h3>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>In Short:</strong> Most web browsers and some mobile operating
      systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or
      setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have
      data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No
      uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
      has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
      signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice
      not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
      that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice
      in a revised version of this privacy policy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>10. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS POLICY?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>In Short:</strong> Yes, we will update this policy as necessary to
      stay compliant with relevant laws.
    </p>

    <p>
      We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version
      will be indicated by an updated “Revised” date and the updated version
      will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes
      to this privacy policy, we may notify you either by prominently posting a
      notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We
      encourage you to review this privacy policy frequently to be informed of
      how we are protecting your information.
