<p>With all of the dating sites and apps out there, if you’re looking for long-term relationships or even love and marriage, it can feel like trying to find a needle in a haystack. If you’re from the South Asian community — Hindi, Bengali, or Punjabi, for example — where you may be looking for people using very specific filters, it can be even harder.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Luckily, Dil Mil is specifically aimed at connecting users from the South Asian community, particularly those who live elsewhere in the world, and are perhaps first generation immigrants to the United States.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If religion, an individual’s background, and other specific cultural factors are particularly important to you for long-term relationships, then it only makes sense that Dil Mil could help you meet the person of your dreams!</p>

<p>Let’s dive straight into it!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-dil-mil">What Is Dil Mil?</h2>
<p>Dil Mil is a South Asian dating site that was acquired by <a href="https://www.datinggrp.com/">Social Discovery Group</a> in 2010. A few of the other dating sites they own include dating.com, AnatasiaDate.com, AsianDate.com, AmoLatina.com, and ArabianDate.com.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Founded by <a href="https://councils.forbes.com/profile/KJ-Dhaliwal-CSO-CEO-Social-Discovery-Group-Dil-Mil/192afdca-bfd8-4e19-9440-a21320bbe08c">KJ Dhaliwal</a>, the company is based in San Francisco. Branded as “Tinder for South Asians”, the app became popular amongst expats from South Asian countries, including India.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/25/dating-com-acquires-dil-mil-app-for-south-asian-expats-as-dating-apps-consolidate">Dhaliwal created the app</a> to help members of the South Asian community find each other in a place away from “home”. It came about as the experience that he and his friends had was that meeting singles who could become potential partners in their new city was increasingly difficult. </p>
<p></p>
<p>With traditional arranged marriage dating services considered “outdated” and most other services on apps and dating websites “culturally inappropriate”, Dhaliwal realized that he could create something to help people just like him.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://eddie-hernandez.com/dil-mil-dating-app-indian-dating-site-south-asian/#:~:text=1.3%20billion%20people%20live%20in%20India%20and%20at%20least%20another%204%20million%20are%20in%20the%20U.S.">The population of India</a> alone is roughly 1.3 billion people, with around 4 million Indian diaspora in the U.S., so it makes sense that Dil Mil has become popular!</p>
<p></p>
<p>With over 2 million users across the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, and UAE, the platform and developers have also successfully managed to raise its profile through music, art, events, and utilizing Bollywood superstars and South Asian influencers in their campaigns.</p>
<h3>The Dil Mil Algorithm</h3>
<p>According to Dil Mil, their app uses a proprietary algorithm. This means that user-set preferences and filters (ie, religion, education, community, location, height, personality traits, and more) are the key to individuals being shown to others. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Your data and answers, therefore, directly affect your potential matches (and the number of them that you’re shown).</p>
<p></p>
<p>This also means that the way in which you swipe on Dil Mil will <em>not</em> affect which accounts you’re shown. The only thing to make sure of, then, is that you’ve selected as many options as possible in your search filters!</p>
<h2 id="what-does-“dil-mil”-mean">What Does “Dil-Mil” Mean?</h2>
<p>“Dil-mil” comes from “<a href="https://www.rekhtadictionary.com/meaning-of-dil-milnaa">dil milnaa</a>”, which in Urdu translates as “[to] have mutual love” or “find [someone] congenial”.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That’s why the Dil Mil slogan is “Love is” — they state that their mission is to “<a href="https://blog.dilmil.co/how-does-dil-mil-work">empower the world to find love and make it as painless of a journey for you as possible</a>”. </p>
<h2 id="dil-mil-user-demographics">Dil Mil User Demographics</h2>
<p>The majority of Dil Mil users tend to be first gen South Asian expats in key diasporic locations. <a href="https://onlineforlove.com/dil-mil-review/#:~:text=Around%20100%20000%20users%20are%20from%20the%20United%20States">According to some stats</a>, there are roughly 100,000 users in the U.S., of whom 50,000 are active.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When it comes to the gender ratio, it’s fairly even, with around 55% identifying as male and 45% identifying as female.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dil Mil is designed for those looking for a relationship that could lead to marriage, and there are plenty of <a href="https://dilmil.co/blog/successstories">success stories</a> on the website. That does mean that if your preferences are for a more casual relationship or friendship, Dil Mil probably isn’t for you! However, if you’re looking for more meaningful connections, chances are high you’ll find it here.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The fact that Dil Mil is aimed at a majority of South Asian users means that you’re more likely to find heterosexual matches (ie, men looking for women), and people who identify as more gender normative, rather than LGBTQIA+ couples or non-binary users.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, there are still queer users on the app, so if you’re part of the LGBTQIA+ community and looking for love on Dil Mil, you may find it!</p>
<p></p>
<p>When it comes to the age range, the majority of active Dil Mil users (50%) fall in the 25–34 age range — which makes sense, as that’s likely to be the age when lots of folks would want to settle down. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The next most popular user age range is 18–24 (40%), and the final age ranges of users are 34–44, 45–54, and 55+ (10%).</p>
<h2 id="pros-of-using-dil-mil">Pros of Using Dil Mil</h2>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Free to download on both Android and iOS</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>No matter what device you’re on, you can download Dil Mil (from either the App Store or Google Play) for free.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>High number of users means high match rate</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are roughly 1,000 new users who sign up for membership <em>every day</em>. That means that the chances of meeting someone who ticks all the boxes on your list is also high!</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>High success rate</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>According to Dil Mil, they have created over <em>20 million matches</em>, with <em>one success story a day!</em></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Easy way to meet other South Asians</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While the app is not limited to just members of the South Asian expat community (anyone can create an account, as long as you have a Facebook account and phone number), almost all active users are.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>User privacy is a priority</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://cdn.dilmil.co/static/privacy-policy/pp-2021-06-24.pdf">Dil Mil has an extensive privacy policy</a>, designed to protect its users.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>There are low or no fake profiles on the app</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, unlike other dating apps, there are <a href="https://blog.dilmil.co/is-dil-mil-safe">next-to-no fake profiles on Dil Mil</a>, and so no scammers to contend with. That’s thanks to profile verification, phone number authentication, and a strong and active human moderation team.</p>
<h2 id="cons-of-using-dil-mil">Cons of Using Dil Mil</h2>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Better features cost money</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to access better features, you’ll need to stump up for VIP Elite, which can get a little pricey. </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Matches are typically far from your area</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, as you can’t set a distance or area filter in the app, that means you may be matched with someone on the other side of the country to you.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Women on the app tend to be less responsive</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Possibly since the top users will be receiving more attention, female users tend to be a little less responsive than male users.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>App may have security issues</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Back in 2020 there was a case where <a href="https://medium.com/@kunala/how-i-hacked-dil-mil-indian-dating-app-to-expose-a-users-exact-location-3eb09bfc3fcd">someone was able to hack Dil Mil</a> and access private user information, including their location, birthdays, and Facebook and Instagram details. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Fortunately, he only did it to see if he <em>could</em>, and then passed this information on to the developers, who were able to fix the security issue. However, that’s not to say that there couldn’t be other security issues in the future.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>App may be buggy</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/ci67nv/anyone_have_this_problem_with_dil_mil">Some Redditors commented</a> that they were matched with users they hadn’t swiped on. Some so much so that it caused them to leave the app.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-the-dil-mil-app">How to Get the Dil Mil App</h2>
<p>You can download the Dil Mil app for free from either the App Store (for iOS devices) or the Google Play store (for Android devices).</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is intended to be used as an app, rather than on desktop (though they do have a web app), so you’ll need to download it to your device.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-get-matches-on-dil-mil">How Do You Get Matches on Dil Mil?</h2>
<p>Dil Mil uses the same swipe structure that you’ll know from other dating apps, such as Tinder. The steps to get a match are very simple:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you want to Like someone, swipe right on their profile. If you want to pass, swipe left (note that Dil Mil likes to refer to left swipes as “passes” rather than “dislikes”).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>If the other person also likes what they see and swipes right, congrats! You’ll be matched!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>However, the process of matching may be very different from how you <em>actually</em> get matches on Dil Mil.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It all comes down to your profile, and the things that you tell potential matches about yourself. Make sure that you fill out every section of your profile, as this will show potential matches that you really care about the details and are taking your dating life seriously.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bearing in mind the information that you provided Dil Mil with upon registration, you’ve then got to put the work into your profile and bio, to prove to everyone that you’re a quality match.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Having said that, talk is cheap, and your profile pictures will have a <em>huge</em> influence on whether or not someone makes the decision to Like your profile so that you can match and start messaging!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ditch the selfies and blurry phone photos, and make sure your profile stands out by investing in professional photographs! Of all the upgrades you could make on your page, this is the one that really counts — and this is where <a href="https://thematchartist.com/online-dating-photographer-near-me">The Match Artist could help</a>!</p>
<p></p>
<p>We specialize in photos for your dating profile that not only look <em>amazing</em> but actually get you more matches! Unconvinced that your profile images could really have such sway? Just check out <a href="https://thematchartist.com/case-studies">our case studies from real clients</a>!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Just as Dil Mil has a high success rate on their app, so do we — proving that of anything else you could do to up your internet dating profile game, improving your profile photos is the best idea!</p>
<h2 id="dil-mil-pricing-structure">Dil Mil Pricing Structure</h2>
<p>The basic version of Dil Mil is free, but there are limited features. At this time, it doesn’t look like you can purchase certain premium features (eg, Boosts or SuperLikes) separately, though this may change in the future.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you decide to upgrade to <a href="https://dilmil.co/vip-elite">Dil Mil VIP Elite</a>, the premium subscription on the app, then there are a few different prices:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For a 1 month subscription, you’ll pay $34.99 per month</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For a 3 month subscription, you’ll pay $23.33 per month</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For a 12 month subscription, you’ll pay $16.67 per month.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Depending on how long you subscribe for, you’ll get a slight discount (37% for 3 months, and 57% for 12 months). You can purchase through the Dil Mil app directly by going to your settings (the gear icon in the app).</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can also purchase either the one or three month subscription for someone else as a gift. Payments are made through your app store and, according to the terms and conditions, there are no refunds for in-app purchases.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There is a free trial period when you sign up for VIP Elite (only one free trial period per user), but bear in mind that if you want to cancel it, you’ll need to make sure you do so 24 hours before your free trial ends through the app store (if purchased through your device). Renewal will happen automatically.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If purchased through the web app, you’ll need to <a href="https://dilmil.helpshift.com/hc/en/3-dil-mil/faq/213-how-do-i-cancel-or-manage-my-subscription">contact Dil Mil’s support team directly</a>.</p>
<h2 id="dil-mil-free-app-features">Dil Mil Free App Features</h2>
<p>With the Dil Mil free app, you’ll only be able to:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Use up to 10 Likes per day</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, with the basic version of the app, you can only swipe right 10 times. Then you’ll have to wait 24 hours before your swipes reset.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Use basic search filters</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you set your profile up, you’ll have to enable your location and notifications, upload a profile photo, and then input your height, ethnic community, religion, education, and career. </p>
<p></p>
<p>You’ll then be able to specify what you’re looking for in a potential partner, which includes desired gender, age range, height, religious leanings, and location, and that’s pretty much it!</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Chat with matches</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll only be able to chat with users you’ve made a match with, but once you’re matched, it’s all go!</p>
<h2 id="premium-app-features">Premium App Features</h2>
<p>Along with your premium subscription, otherwise known as VIP Elite, you can enjoy:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The ability to match instantly with others</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>No need to wait around, with this feature you can see exactly who’s already swiped right on you, then swipe right back (if so desired)!</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>One free Boost per month</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Boosts push you to the top of the match queue and allow your profile to be seen up to 10 times more than regular users!</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Advanced filters</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With this feature you can set even more filters to satisfy even the pickiest of daters (and their parents!).</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The ability to change your location to anywhere in the world</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>No luck in your location, moving, or looking to broaden your horizons? This feature will allow you to set your location anywhere globally.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Unlimited Likes</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On the basic app, you’ll be limited to 10 Likes per day. However, with the VIP Elite subscription, you can keep swiping to your heart’s content.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The ability to swipe on Elite Picks</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Elite Picks are 12 featured “top” Dil Mil profiles. They’re refreshed every 24 hours. Free users can see only a few of the profiles, and won’t be able to interact with them. However, VIP Elite users will be able to see everything and can swipe on any of the profiles if the person seems like your type!</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>One free Super Like daily</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Super Likes on Dil Mil work in the same way that they do on Tinder — they’re a way to let other users know that you’re <em>really</em> interested in them. Every time that person uses the app, your profile will appear first in their match queue. VIP Elite members will get one per day.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>One free Request per day</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Requests are personalized messages that you can send along with your Like. It gives your potential match an extra reason to consider swiping right on your profile, too. VIP Elite members will get one per day.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Access to Dil Details</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Dil Details are specific facts about another user, taken from their responses to certain questions when they signed up. They’re essentially a few extra notes about the person, that could help you decide if they’re going to be the one for you!</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can also see some essential information about your own profile, which includes feedback about activity on your profile. You’ll be able to see traits about the people who have swiped right on you, the places they’re from, and other key information.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Information refreshes every 24 hours, and only VIP Elite members have access to other people’s Dil Details (and their own).</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Unlimited Rewinds</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Rewinds will let you “undo” the last left swipe you made, in case you’ve changed your mind, or accidentally swiped the wrong way. You can access Rewinds by either pressing the Rewind button (top-left corner of your profile), or by shaking your phone. Only VIP Elite members have access to Rewinds.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>One free read receipt per month</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>VIP Elite members will be able to turn on read receipts for conversations once a month. Pretty handy if you’re not sure if your communication is getting through to the other person!</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The ability to reset your left swipes</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to Rewinds, if you’re a VIP Elite member, you’ll be able to reset <em>all</em> of your left swipes if so desired! Hasty swiping can be a bit of a problem on dating apps, so this gives you a quick and to the point way of addressing the issue, if you perhaps got a little swipe happy and acted too quickly.</p>
<h3>Is Dil Mil VIP Elite Worth the Cost?</h3>
<p>While <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/s85r1a/dil_mil_premium_is_it_worth_it">user reviews</a> are pretty <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthAsianMasculinity/comments/yhi9es/dil_mil_review_thread">mixed</a>, in our opinion, if you’re a guy, it’s quite difficult to use Dil Mil without upgrading to VIP Elite. The basic version has quite limited functionality, which makes it harder to meet and connect with people.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Remember, there is a free trial available for VIP Elite, so you could always try it out and see if it works for you. Just remember to cancel 24 hours <em>before</em> the trial date ends if you don’t want to pay the subscription fee!</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the other hand, if you’re a girl, you probably don’t need to upgrade to VIP Elite in order to get the Likes coming in!</p>
<h3>Dil Mil Concierge Service</h3>
<p>If you don’t have time to spend swiping on the app until you meet “the one”, Dil Mil has introduced a personalized matchmaking service which can put in all the work for you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Simply answer a few questions from their quiz and set your filters (eg, preference for region, which South Asian communities, etc), and Dil Mil Concierge will get to work for you. You can also pause the service at any time, if you want to get back to swiping.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While Dil Mil Concierge is activated, you should see both matches and messages from potential partners chosen for you by your personal matchmaker. <em>How much easier could it get?</em></p>
<h2 id="dil-mil-photo-guide">Dil Mil Photo Guide</h2>
<p>Dil Mil has certain <a href="https://dilmil.helpshift.com/hc/en/3-dil-mil/faq/184-why-has-my-profile-picture-been-rejected">photo guidelines</a> they’ve put in place to help ensure the safety of the platform for everyone, and keep the catfish at bay!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Photos that will not be approved on your profile include:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Photos where you’re wearing sunglasses (<em>a huge no-no for online dating profiles!</em>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Photos where your face isn’t clearly visible (ie, it’s blurry, there’s a filter, or it doesn’t show your full face)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Group photos (including photos with just one other person)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Photos that aren’t of you (eg, photos of celebrities, animals, objects, or children)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Shirtless or nude photos.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Dil Mil will allow you to upload up to six photos on your profile, and our best advice is to <em>use those six photos wisely!</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Photos are worth a thousand words, so make sure your photos tell a story about who you are and the things you like doing. While cell phone selfies are a bit 2000-and-late, a great, clear and professional headshot could get the Likes pouring in!</p>
<p></p>
<p>If your photography skills aren’t up to scratch, <a href="https://thematchartist.com/online-dating-photographer-near-me">get in touch with The Match Artist</a>! Our professional photographers will spend four to five hours with you on your shoot day to take as many amazing photos of you as possible, in a variety of locations (both indoors and outdoors) and outfits, so that no matter what vibe you’re going for, you can achieve it!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Don’t forget that on your dating app profile you’ll need to hook any potential matches in a short period of time. That all comes down to how you present yourself, which is why we offer facial expression coaching to all our clients.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Want to look a little mysterious? That’ll all be in how you look at the camera. And, if you want to look like marriage material — confident, kind, funny, etc — then that comes down to your facial expression, too!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Don’t worry — we’ll not only coach you through it before your photoshoot and set you homework (<em>get practicing in front of that mirror!</em>), we’ll also be on hand on the day to help refine your look.</p>
<h2 id="dil-mil-conversation-starters:-a-guide-to-get-more-matches">Dil Mil Conversation Starters: A Guide to Get More Matches</h2>
<p>Starting a conversation on Dil Mil is much the same as on any other dating app. Thanks to competition from other users, you’ll want to make sure that your message stands out from the crowd.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While that may sound a little easier said than done, don’t worry! We’ve got you covered with our guide to sending messages that’ll get you more matches.</p>
<h3>1. Keep It Simple</h3>
<p>Trust us — nobody wants to read an essay as their first message! Keep your first message short and to the point, and give the other person the opportunity to respond.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And, please, don’t just send a “Hey” message! It’s low effort and lazy, and guaranteed to <em>not</em> get a response!</p>
<h3>2. Compliments Will Get You Everywhere</h3>
<p>Genuine compliments, in good measure, are an easy way to flatter a person. Not only that, but <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/nz/blog/evidence-based-living/202109/the-psychology-compliments-nice-word-goes-long-way">research has shown</a> that both the recipient and compliment giver’s mood is improved!</p>
<p></p>
<p>The key is to make sure that the compliment is <em>genuine</em>. While they may be the hottest person to ever land on your screen, just saying, “You’re hot, LOL” isn’t going to cut the mustard. Go a little deeper!</p>
<h3>3. Use the Info You’ve Been Given</h3>
<p>You literally have an <em>entire</em> profile’s worth of information to tap into for your first message — use it!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Maybe they’re a movie buff, or a big reader. Use this information to create a deeper connection and show that you’ve actually spent the time to look through their profile properly.</p>
<h3>4. Ask Open-Ended Questions</h3>
<p>Open-ended questions (ie, questions that encourage the other person to answer in more depth than just “yes” or “no”) are a great way to get your match to share a little about themselves. And you shouldn’t be afraid to do the same!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sharing personal information — also known as “self-disclosure” — can help you bond with another person and help create intimacy, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/nz/blog/click-here-for-happiness/202210/why-self-disclosure-is-good-for-relationships">according to psychology</a>. Just be sure not to overshare!</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you’re not sure where to start, you can always try the “two truths and a lie” game! It’s a conversation starter that’s sure to get some rapport going.</p>
<h3>5. Go With the Flow</h3>
<p>Remember what we said about using the other person’s profile for clues? That same profile is also going to give you an indication of the tone with which you should send your first message.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If your match seems like they’d be into it, you could go for a slightly flirty or fun first message. </p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, <em>“I’ve been swiping on here all day, but yours is the first profile I’ve seen that I’d be proud to show my mother! Want to grab a coffee and see if I’d make your mother proud, too?”</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>If, however, they seem a little more conservative, then go with the tried-and-tested formula:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Greeting + genuine compliment + something you noticed from their profile + open-ended question.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>For example: <em>“Hi, I’m [insert name]. I couldn’t help but stop when I saw your profile — you have the most incredible eyes! I see you’re really into reading — what’s the last book you read?”</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Remember, go with the flow and keep it light to begin with!</p>
<h2 id="how-does-dil-mil-work-for-guys">How Does Dil Mil Work for Guys</h2>
<p>Dil Mil works for guys in a very similar way to how it works for girls. Both will have to:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Download the app</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sign up using either a phone number or Facebook</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Verify their phone number and email</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enable location and notifications</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Set up their profile</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Set up their preferences and filters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The swiping process is very much the same, too — swipe right to Like a profile, or left to Pass. Even the ratio of guys to girls on the app is fairly equal, and once you’ve matched, either party can message first.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The only thing that may be different when it comes to a guy’s experience on the app vs. a girl’s, is that women tend to be less responsive — potentially because <a href="https://healthyframework.com/dating/review/dil-mil/#:~:text=Now%2C%20things%20took,hear%20from%20us">they receive a lot more first messages from guys than they send</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All the more reason to make sure that your profile <em>really</em> stands out from the crowd!</p>
<h2 id="is-dil-mil-a-scam">Is Dil Mil a Scam?</h2>
<p>While you may be wondering if Dil Mil is a scam, rest assured that it’s totally legit! </p>
<p></p>
<p>The business and rights have been owned by the <a href="https://www.datinggrp.com/">Social Discovery Group</a> (formerly Dating Group) since 2010, who are an established and well-known brand, and also own a number of other dating websites. Additionally, there are plenty of users on the app worldwide.</p>
<h2 id="dil-mil-safety-facts">Dil Mil Safety Facts</h2>
<p>While no dating app is ever <em>100%</em> safe, there are certain measures that the app (and you!) can put in place to make sure that your experience is fun and safe.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here are the things that Dil Mil does:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Profile verification</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While not compulsory, it’s highly recommended that users go through the photo verification process on Dil Mil. It’s easy to do and shows other users that you’re trustworthy and — most of all — real!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Simply:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tap the grey checkmark by your name on your account</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Follow the on-screen prompts to take a selfie matching the pose shown</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Upload and submit the photo to the Dil Mil team</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When reviewed and approved, you’ll receive a push notification and a blue checkmark next to your name.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>You’ll also have access to Mil &amp; Chill once you’ve verified your account — the app’s community chat service.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Phone number authentication</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you sign up for Dil Mil, you’ll need to enter a valid phone number in order to create your account (only one account per number). You’ll then be asked to verify your phone number, by entering the code sent to you by SMS.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This means that if you later delete your profile and then recreate it, the Dil Mil team will be able to check that you are still who you say you are, and aren’t trying to catfish on the app.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While it’s not 100% secure (someone could use a burner phone to create a new profile, for example), it’s still much more secure than other apps!</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Active moderation team</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Online communities are only as good as their moderation teams! Luckily, Dil Mil has a very active moderation team who not only make sure policies and safety features are being followed, they also review all photos that are uploaded to profiles.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Zero-tolerance policy for harassment</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Nobody should have to put up with being harassed while they’re trying to find love online, and Dil Mil agrees! When accounts are reported for harassment, they’ll investigate and, if verified, will ban the user. They’ll then be unable to sign up for a new account again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If someone is harassing you on the app, be sure to take screenshots to provide to the moderation team.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Strong data privacy policy</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While some dating app services may sell your data to third-party services, Dil Mil does not — even after you’ve deleted your profile. This includes messages, personal info, and photos.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can <a href="https://cdn.dilmil.co/static/privacy-policy/2021-03-17.pdf">read the full privacy policy here</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In terms of things <em>you</em> can do to keep yourself safe, practice good internet safety habits! This includes:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Not sharing personal information, such as your address or phone number publicly</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Being careful not to upload photos that may reveal places you like to frequent</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Never share your password</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Don’t send any money to strangers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If in doubt, block and report!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ghosting-on-dil-mil">Ghosting on Dil Mil</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/pzyhab/share_your_best_dil_mil_ghosting_story">ghosting happens</a>, no matter what app you’re on. While it may seem like the easiest way out of a conversation you don’t see going anywhere, or with someone who appears to be a little toxic, we’d always recommend taking the high road and sending a message to explain that you’re not interested. It’s just the polite thing to do!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Don’t do a “<a href="https://www.allure.com/story/caspering-new-dating-trend-ghosting">Casper</a>” either (a non-committal friendly message which never follows through). Instead, keep it short, be honest, and give the other person closure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And, if you’re the unfortunate recipient of a ghoster, don’t dwell on it. If they couldn’t give you the decency of a proper response and closure, then they don’t deserve any more of your attention! </p>
<p></p>
<p>Grieve the waste of your time, maybe take a breather away from the app for some self care, and then move on!</p>
<h2 id="fake-profiles-on-dil-mil">Fake Profiles on Dil Mil</h2>
<p>Even though Dil Mil has certain practices in place to discourage fake profiles, it doesn’t eliminate them entirely. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Having said that, thanks to the moderation practices and profile and phone number verification procedures, the number of fake profiles on the app is very low. Much lower, in fact, than other dating apps.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you suspect that you’ve stumbled across an unverified fake profile, be sure to report it!</p>
<h2 id="if-i’m-not-south-asian,-can-i-use-dil-mil">If I’m Not South Asian, Can I Use Dil Mil?</h2>
<p>It doesn’t matter what ethnicity you are, anyone can sign up for Dil Mil! Just be aware that the primary audience is South Asians looking for long-term relationships or marriage with other South Asians, so you may find that your profile drops to the bottom of the list.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you’re not South Asian, you’re likely to have more luck on other dating apps, such as Tinder, Hinge, or Bumble.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-dating-apps-to-dil-mil">Alternative Dating Apps to Dil Mil</h2>
<p>While Dil Mil is a great app for South Asians looking to meet other South Asians overseas, there are a few other apps also offering the same service. </p>
<p></p>
<p>So, if you’re not having much luck on Dil Mil, why not check out some of the alternatives?</p>
<h3>EME Hive</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.emehive.co/">EME Hive</a> (formerly East Meet East) is specifically for Asian-Americans. However, the user base is about half of Dil Mils, and they have a known fake profile issue (including impersonation of Asians by non-Asian men).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additionally, free accounts have pretty limited capabilities, including the fact that match chats are hidden behind a paywall.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, there have been some updates to the app, meaning that you can connect with other South Asians without needing to upgrade to a premium account. Just watch out for the catfish!</p>
<h3>AsianDating</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.asiandating.com/">AsianDating</a> is a dating app from <a href="https://www.cupidmedia.com/">CupidMedia</a> and has been running for over 10 years. As one of the first niche dating sites, it’s well known and used internationally.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When compared to Dil Mil, there are roughly double the amount of users. However, as they are from all around the world, make sure that you set your preferences and match criteria carefully, or you could end up matching with someone on the other side of the globe! <a href="https://healthyframework.com/dating/review/asian-dating/#:~:text=In%20terms%20of%20what%20people%20seemed%20to%20be%20looking%20for%20on%20Asiandating.com%2C%20it%20seems%20that%20a%20higher%20percentage%20of%20people%20than%20normal%20were%20looking%20for%20something%20serious">Most users on the app are looking for a more serious relationship</a>, too, so if that’s your criteria, you’re bound to find a match.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bear in mind that the profiles on AsianDating are <em>significant</em> in terms of content, so those who aren’t careful readers may find it a little tiring! However, it does tell you not only their vital stats and information, but also what they’re looking for in an ideal match — which makes it pretty easy to narrow down your choices!</p>
<p></p>
<p>AsianDating is a paid site only (their cheapest option works out to be just over $10 per month for 12 months), but does offer a free trial. So, if Dil Mil is turning up no luck for you, you could cast your net a little wider.</p>
<h3>Aisle</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.aisle.co/">Aisle</a> is another popular app for South Asians, with a slightly larger user base than Dil Mil. It’s also popular amongst those looking for long-term relationships but, unfortunately, doesn’t have very strict verification policies and suffers from fake profiles as a result.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While you can use the app for free, there are significant drawbacks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Similar to Bumble, women have first message privileges, but men are able to send first messages if they upgrade their account. While everyone can send messages for free, reading them is hidden behind a paywall — <em>frustrating!</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Users are global, so you can (in theory) meet people from all over the world. However, there are significantly more men than women on the app, so women may find themselves inundated!</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, as it does have a larger user base, you may meet your ideal match on Aisle more easily than on Dil Mil. Just bear in mind that you <em>will</em> have to pay!</p>

<p>Yes, you can access Dil Mil from a desktop computer using their web app. </p>
