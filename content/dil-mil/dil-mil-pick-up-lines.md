Dil Mil Pick-Up Lines
=====================

Online dating isn’t so simple as getting on the app and starting to swipe. One of the key parts is what you actually send to other people as your first message!

But what makes good conversation starters and how do you get conversations flowing with someone?

In this article we’re going to cover:

*   What Dil Mil is
    
*   How to prepare yourself for success on the app
    
*   Examples for the perfect pick-up line
    
*   Frequently asked questions.
    

Ready to dive in so you can craft the best first pick up lines to your match? Let’s get started!

What Is Dil Mil?
----------------

Dil Mil is a specialist dating site, specifically aimed at expat South Asians (ie, desi users). It has over 2 million users in key diasporic markets, including the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, and UAE.

Described as “Tinder for South Asians,” Dil Mil uses the same swipe mechanism as other dating apps you may be familiar with. Simply swipe right to like a profile, or swipe left to pass.

The algorithm is proprietary, which means that the data you provide Dil Mil is how you’re matched with others. And the information, preferences, and filters are wide ranging! You can find the man or woman of your dreams down to their level of education, religious views, ethnic community, location, and even _height!_

The majority of users on Dil Mil have rejected traditional matchmaking, or introductions from parents or friends. Thus, those on the app tend to be looking for men or women for real connections, long-term relationships and marriage.

While the majority of users are heterosexual (ie, guys looking for girls, and vice versa), there is a proportion of queer users on the app. And while most people are looking for girlfriends or boyfriends they could take home to the family, the app’s ability to match you with someone anywhere in the world, could mean new friendships, too.

While primarily aimed at South Asians, everyone is welcome on Dil Mil, and there are plenty of users who are not South Asian.

### Is Dil Mil a Real Dating Site?

Yes, Dil Mil is very much a real dating site! They boast plenty of matches — 20 million, in fact! They also claim to hear about one success story through the app _every day_.

### Is Dil Mil Safe?

While nothing on the Internet is ever 100% safe, Dil Mil has [practically no fake profiles and no scammers](https://blog.dilmil.co/is-dil-mil-safe) on the platform. They use profile verification, including phone number authentication to achieve this, along with a very active human moderation team.

### Is Dil Mil Free?

The basic version of Dil Mil is free. However, with the free version there are significantly less features, notably access to most of the filters that make Dil Mil so popular. You’ll also only have access to 10 swipes a day, then have to wait for 24 hours before this resets.

To access the better features and unlimited swipes, you’ll have to sign up for [Dil Mil VIP Elite](https://dilmil.co/vip-elite), which can be quite expensive.

Preparing for Success with Dil Mil
----------------------------------

Our top tips for optimizing your profile include:

*   Make sure you’ve fully filled out your profile
    

*   Make good use of the filters to narrow down your potential matches, but don’t be too picky
    

*   Ensure that your location settings are set properly
    

*   Craft an interesting (but short) bio that tells the other person about your interests and contains conversation starters
    

*   Use the allocated six picture slots to upload great profile images.

### The Secret of a Successful Dil Mil Pickup Line

The best Dil Mil pick up lines are ones that _start a conversation_. You don’t have to be the funniest person in the world, you don’t have to bear your heart and soul in that first message, you just need to _get the other person talking!_

Make sure you pay attention to the other person’s profile. If they mention that they like books and food, craft a message that mentions something about their interests, and be sure to direct the message back at them!

You don’t have to lead with a joke, either — pay attention to the tone of their profile and the things they like, and go from there!

Some examples of potential first messages:

*   “Quick fire, choose one! You’re looking at the menu, do you choose pizza or pasta?”
    

*   “Are you more of a sweet or spicy chai kind of person?”
    

*   “Hi, \[insert name\]. You look amazing in that sari in your profile pic! Was it a special event?”
    

### The Best Opening Line Depends on the Age of the Person You’re Talking to

Just as everyone is different, there’s no one-size-fits-all opening line on Dil Mil. Pay attention to the basics on their profile!

How old are they? Do they seem more conservative or liberal? Do they seem like they’d be down for a more flirty opener or something a bit more chill to begin with?

Remember, you’re looking for a _genuine_ connection with another person. You’re only going to get that if you put the time into getting to know them.

### Is It Okay to Just Start with “Hey”?

“Hey” or “hi” may seem like pretty lackluster first messages to send when online dating. It doesn’t give much insight into your personality or your mind. 

For some people, they may not even bother replying, especially if it’s a choice between your “hey” or another person’s more well-crafted and thoughtful message!

On Dil Mil, especially, women can be a bit less responsive, likely thanks to the fact that the top-rated profiles receive a lot more attention. So, if you really want to get a reply, give the other person a reason to!

### The Best Opening Lines May Vary by City

Just as you need to pay attention to the other person’s profile details, you also need to pay attention to what city they’re from and live in.

Maybe your ideal match is from an area you know really well, or you went to the same college — that’s a perfect place to start a conversation from!

Remember, in the world of online dating, any commonalities are your lifeline, so grab hold to those words and stories and cling on tight.
