How to Register For Dil Mil
---------------------------

All you need to [register for Dil Mil](https://blog.dilmil.co/how-does-dil-mil-work/) is a phone number or Facebook account, and the desire to find love! Registration is as easy as downloading Dil Mil from the Apple or Android app store and verifying your phone number and email.

Once you are registered, it’s [time to get creative](https://blog.dilmil.co/5-ways-to-spice-up-your-dating-profile/)! Upload photos that tell your story, and represent your life and interests. Make your bio punchy and specific. Write about your hobbies and your passions — the things that make your life unique.

When you are creating a profile, ask yourself these questions:

1.  Do I want to know more about this person?
    

2.  Am I interested in this person’s interests?
    

3.  Does this person look like they have a life I want to be a part of?
    

4.  Is this person’s personality (and features) highlighted by their pictures?
    

If you can answer yes to all of those questions, you’re doing okay!

Dil Mil also has its members provide additional information, which it uses to filter matches. This helps Dil Mil’s algorithm match people with each other that have a good chance of forming successful relationships.

Location, height, gender, religion or community, career, and education are all important data points when it comes to dating. In addition to hard data, singles on Dil Mil select personality traits which best describe them to others.

As well as inputting your personal raw stats, you can set up your own filters for age, religion, height, etc, etc. There are also options for indicating the kind of connection you are seeking — casual, dating, or long term.

Connecting your Instagram to Dil Mil will also give other profiles a better insight into your life and personality. Just make sure that your Insta is telling the right story _before_ you connect it!

The better your profile, the greater your chances are of getting likes, messages, and starting conversations that turn into dates!

How Matching Works on Dil Mil
-----------------------------

Matches on Dil Mil are based on compatibility and mutual interest. The algorithm puts individuals that have complementary preferences onto one another’s feeds. When someone appears on your feed, you review their profile — choosing to like or pass on them. 

If you like someone, and they like you back, then _congrats!_ You’ve got a match. 

This system is similar to other dating apps you might have tried. 

Still, the dating experience is very different to most other platforms. That’s because Dil Mil reflects the specific priorities of its South Asian membership and developers.

### The Dil Mil Algorithm

Dil Mil’s proprietary algorithm accesses _all_ the preferences of _all_ of its member accounts. 

Accounts with compatible preferences are shown to one another — which leads to matches, dates, and relationships. 

The exact ins and outs of the Dil Mil algorithm’s process is a trade secret. Fortunately, you don’t need to know the math to make the most of Dil Mil!

What Is the Average Age of Female Users on Dil Mil?
---------------------------------------------------

Dil Mil is a site built with a specific age group and population in mind. It’s geared towards helping a South Asian “[20-something-year-old find someone who Mummy and Papa will approve of](https://indiacurrents.com/the-dil-mil-lennials/)”.

A reliable source for user statistics isn’t currently available for Dil Mil. However, if we look at the way the app is marketed and designed, we can begin to form a picture. 

Most of the women on Dil Mil are likely younger Millennials and older Gen Zs, with ages ranging from 20–30.

Common Issues You May Encounter on Dil Mil as a Guy
---------------------------------------------------

Guys on dating sites tend to match less. If you’re a guy, don’t let that discourage you. Let's have a look at a few examples of problems guys often run into when dating online.

### Lack of Matches in Your Area

If you don’t have many compatible users near the place you live, you won’t get lots of matches! You can either travel for love, or adjust your location settings.

The truth is, your perfect match could be living _anywhere_ in the world. If you have very specific preferences, you might need to open your mind to dating long distance. 

### Your Matches May Ghost You

Don’t take it personally if your match ghosts you. People are complicated and they lead complicated lives. Your match may have ghosted you for any number of reasons that have _nothing_ to do with you or your profile.

With that in mind, there is one thing that guys can do to reduce the number of ghostings they experience. 

Keep in mind, dating random men online is quite dangerous for a lot of people. So if a red flag pops up, or the vibe feels off, many people will simply ghost a match.

So if you are a guy, make sure you take all the steps you can to foster a safe vibe. On your profile, during online messaging, and in person. This will help reduce the number of matches that ghost you.

### You May Chat With a Fake Account

Dil Mil does a pretty good job of weeding out fake accounts. Still, a smart [catfish](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=catfish) can find their way onto the app. 

If you suspect you are chatting with a catfish, [ask yourself](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/love-sex/relationships/a32870367/catfish-meaning/):

1.  Does the user look ridiculously attractive — like a model or [camgirl](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=camgirl)?
    

2.  Does your match refuse to video call, voice call, or meet up?
    

3.  Has your match ever asked you for money?
    

4.  Do things seem _too_ perfect? 
    

Any one of these behaviors is a little suspicious. If you’re answering yes to two or more of these questions, chances are you’ve caught a catfish. 

How to Get More Matches on Dil Mil
----------------------------------

If you want more matches on Dil Mil, you need to optimize your profile. That means an interesting bio, accurate statistics, and social media links. 

You should also consider broadening your search. Consider switching up your location, age, gender, and relationship preferences. 

If none of those things work for you, you can also try subscribing to Dil Mil’s premium option, [VIP Elite](https://dilmil.co/vip-elite). VIP Elite gives you access to profile Boosts, the ability to view which accounts have already liked you, global location settings, and more.

Virtual speed dating is _exactly_ what it sounds like. Personalized matchmaking cuts out the swiping, with matchmakers sending you a number of matches per day.

However, above all, the absolute best way to improve your dating profile, is to make sure that your photos are high-quality, recent, and show you off in the best light.
