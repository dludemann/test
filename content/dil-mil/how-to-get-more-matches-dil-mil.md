Why Am I Not Receiving Matches on Dil Mil?
------------------------------------------

If you’re struggling to receive matches on Dil Mil, there could be several factors at play. 

One reason might be your [profile’s quality](https://dilmil.helpshift.com/hc/en/3-dil-mil/faq/199-why-am-i-not-receiving-matches/?s=matches&f=why-am-i-not-receiving-matches). 

Ensure that your bio effectively communicates your interests, hobbies, education, and personality traits, giving people an insight into who you are.

Dil Mil allows you to upload six photos to your profile, so make sure you include clear and attractive photos that highlight your best side, as first impressions are crucial in the world of online dating!

That means it’s time to ditch the selfies and gym photos, and start leveling up your profile pics. Not sure where to start? That’s where [The Match Artist can help](https://thematchartist.com/online-dating-photographer-near-me)!

Our professional photographers know everything there is to know about taking amazing dating profile pics, meaning more matches for you! No matter how you want to present yourself to the world, just tell your photographer, and they’ll make sure every photo hits its mark.

Another aspect to consider is your account preferences, such as age range, religion, and location filters. 

While Dil Mil has all of these filters for a reason — after all, South Asian dating when looking for someone to take home to the family can be quite particular — by being too restrictive, you may be limiting your chances of finding a match. Broadening your search criteria in order to lead to more connections is a great method.

Lastly, review the way you present yourself that may be turning people off from engaging you in conversation. Include a few conversation starters in your profile that are thoughtful and engaging, as well as showcase your interests. This can make a lasting impression and improve your chances of making more matches.

One last thing to consider: if you really aren’t getting any matches, you could try upgrading to Dil Mil’s VIP Elite membership for access to premium features, such as SuperLikes, Requests, and advanced filters. These could help enhance your experience and boost your chances of success.

How the Dil Mil Algorithm Works
-------------------------------

Though the company keeps some aspects of its algorithm under wraps (_it’s_ [_proprietary_](https://blog.dilmil.co/how-does-dil-mil-work/#:~:text=We%20use%20a%20proprietary%20algorithm,matched%20and%20can%20start%20chatting!)_!_), there are several key elements that influence the way matches are presented to users.

One factor that plays a part in the algorithm is the information you provide in your profile. Details such as age, location, religion, education, and interests help the app suggest potential matches who share similar backgrounds, values, or preferences. 

That’s why something every Dil Mil user should do is ensure their profile is complete and accurate, as it’ll increase the likelihood of finding compatible matches.

The algorithm also considers user engagement, taking into account factors such as response times, conversation lengths, and the quality of messages exchanged. 

What’s the point in that? Well, by participating in genuine and meaningful conversations, you improve your chances of being suggested to other members.

Another element that affects the algorithm is your in-app activity, such as swipes, likes, and Super Likes. Dil Mil’s algorithm considers your choices and adjusts its recommendations accordingly, fine-tuning the suggestions based on your demonstrated preferences.

Lastly, upgrading to VIP Elite membership can also influence the algorithm by offering advanced filters and exclusive features that allow you to narrow down your search, further tailoring match suggestions to your preferences.

Is Dil Mil Location Based?
--------------------------

Dil Mil is indeed a location-based dating app (though you can’t restrict the distance, meaning you could match with someone on the other side of the country), designed to connect South Asian singles.

If you’re looking to expand your search to another country — perhaps if you’re moving overseas and hoping to find singles in the South Asian community there — Dil Mil offers the option to modify your location preferences. 

This feature can be particularly useful for men and women open to long-distance relationships, or seeking friends with shared interests in other parts of the world.
