Dil Mil, the app specifically for the South Asian expat community looking for that special someone for love and marriage, has some great features — as long as you’re willing to pay for them.

While you can get by with the basic, free version of the dating app, the premium version offers so many more options which could help you make better connections, have better conversations, and match with more users.

In this article we’ll cover:

*   The reasons why you should consider upgrading to Dil Mil VIP Elite
    

*   The 10 premium features that could increase your chances of meeting the right person for you!
    

Let’s get straight into it!

Why You Should Consider Investing in Dil Mil VIP Elite
------------------------------------------------------

Dil Mil’s premium subscription, [VIP Elite](https://dilmil.co/vip-elite), is not _necessarily_ essential in order to use the app and make matches. However, it could _significantly_ improve your user experience.

As much as Dil Mil’s mission is to “empower the world to find love”, the app’s creators still favor’s everyone who pays for the app!

When you upgrade to VIP Elite, not only do you have access to unlimited likes (which could help you make more matches in a shorter period of time), you can also use a host of other features which could help you stand out from the crowd.

This includes being able to set filters and preferences to really hone in on the details, change your location to anywhere in the world, and use Requests — messages you can send along with your like to help sway a potential match’s decision.

Dil Mil’s male to female ratio may be very even, especially when compared to other dating apps, but it still suffers from the same problem all dating sites do: women are often inundated with messages from men. As a result, they experience more dating fatigue, and are more judicious about their swipes.

It’s even _more_ important, then, to ensure that your profile is optimized and sits at the top of the match deck!

And with VIP Elite, you can make sure of the latter.

10 Premium Features to Up Your Game
-----------------------------------

To help convince you, here’s a round up of 10 premium features which could help you make more matches!

### 1\. Ability to Swipe for Matches Around the World

When you sign up for VIP Elite, you’ll be able to swipe globally and potentially match with members in any country or city around the world.

Whether you’re looking to connect with people in a city you’re about to move to, or just want to see who else is out there in the big wide world of dating, you can!

After all, with [1.3 billion in India and 4 million throughout the U.S.](https://eddie-hernandez.com/dil-mil-dating-app-indian-dating-site-south-asian), why not cast your net as wide as possible!

### 2\. Unlimited Likes

On the free version of Dil Mil, you’ll be limited to 10 likes daily. These refresh every 24 hours.

Now, while it isn’t impossible to match with other singles with only 10 likes (and don’t forget, once you have matched, messaging is unlimited), it does change the experience of the app.

Limited likes can force you to be more discerning with your likes. However, what happens if you’ve just used your last like and then up pops the person of your dreams?

Well, with the free version of Dil Mil, you’d have to wait 24 hours to be able to send them a like. In the incredibly competitive world of online dating, that’s an eternity!

Luckily, with VIP Elite, you have unlimited likes, so you can _swipe while the iron’s hot!_

### 3\. Ability to Get Instant Matches

With VIP Elite, you’ll be given the information of which user has already swiped right on your profile. That means that if you like them too, you’ll be able to instantly match with them, without having to go through the steps required to hopefully make a match!

It’s something that sets Dil Mil apart from other apps, and all you need to do is pay a little money each month, then be rewarded with instant potential relationships!

### 4\. Ability to Boost Your Profile

Boosts push your profile to the top of the match queue for an hour at a time, making it more likely that others will see you. Then, if they like your pictures or see some things they vibe with on your profile, they’ll be more likely to swipe right on you.

VIP Elite members receive one free boost per month, though you can buy them outside of this limit.

### 5\. See Your Mutual Friends

With VIP Elite, you’ll have the ability to see if you and your potential match have any mutual friends with each other. 

Dil Mil pulls this information from your Facebook account, so if you link your Facebook account as well as your phone number when going through registration, you’ll have this data available.

### 6\. Ability to Send Notes

Known as a Request, as a VIP Elite member you’ll be able to send a message (perhaps a question or response to someone’s profile) along with your like to another user.

This is also a feature other dating apps, such as Bumble have, and it’s a highly effective way to make sure that your profile stands out from the crowd. In fact, most people who utilize Requests are more likely to have their potential match swipe right on them.

Just be sure that your message actually responds to something on their profile, and not just physical attributes!

VIP Elite Members receive one Request per day to use.

### 7\. Access to Advanced Search Filters

There are certain things that are more important to South Asian singles when looking for a long-term partner, including the place you grew up, community, religion, education, career path, and more. While you can set certain filters with a basic account, they are quite limited.

With VIP Elite, you’ll be able to specifically set a whole heap of filters to ensure that your sweetheart doesn’t just win your heart, but also your family’s!

### 8\. Ability to Rewind Your Matches

For all those times when you’ve swiped left on someone and then thought, “Oh no! I made a mistake!”, the Rewind function on Dil Mil is exactly to remedy that situation.

With your VIP Elite subscription you’ll be able to undo the last left swipe you made so that you can have another look and see if there may be a love connection after all!

### 9\. Ability to Reset Dislikes

Lots of folks have sometimes swiped through everyone available in their location and then reached the dreaded end of the match queue. While one way to see who else may be out there is to have another look at your filters, another is simply to reset your dislikes.

With VIP Elite, you’ll be able to reset everyone you’ve swiped left on, rethink your reviews of their profiles, and maybe connect with someone!

### 10\. Dil Mil Concierge Service

Finally, the last VIP Elite feature on our list is the Dil Mil Concierge Service. This is a way for you to go completely hands off with the matching process, and allow someone else to personally select your matches (with a little feedback from you).

Every day, you’ll be presented with some matches (and potentially some messages) for you to decide whether or not you want to pursue. Perfect for those leading busy lives with no time to trawl through the app themselves!

Dil Mil’s Premium Features: The Rundown FAQs

If not, you’ll be charged automatically and thanks to the no-refund policy on in-app purchases, you’ll be stuck.

### What are Elite Picks on Dil Mil premium?

Every 24 hours, the algorithm picks 12 top accounts to display, known as Elite Picks. 

If you’re a VIP Elite member, you’ll be able to view all of these profiles and interact with them (ie, swipe on them). If you match, you’ll then be able to chat with them as usual.

Free users can only see a portion of daily Elite Picks and won’t have the ability to interact with them.
