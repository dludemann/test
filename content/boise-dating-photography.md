        Before getting pics taken by The Match Artist, I was getting 2-3 tinder
        matches a week. After getting new high value pictures from The Match
        Artist and tweaking my bio I was getting over 5 matches per day with
        really great girls. The results truly speak for themselves.

        I was hesitant to invest in what I thought were glorified glamour shots,
        and worried that the results would be a little cheesy... but I was also
        fed up with hours of mediocre results with my mirror selfies and cropped
        group photos... I was intimidated going into it but that was immediately
        alleviated. They did a great job of making me relaxed, comfortable, and
        confident.  And the results... WOW! Way more matches and likes, but the
        increase in the follow-through rate was the noticeable difference. No
        more expired Bumble matches waiting for that first outreach!

    faqs:
      - question: Should I hire an online dating photographer?
        answer:
          Photos are arguably the most important part of your dating profile.
          When you upgrade your photos, you upgrade your matches. If you want
          to meet even more amazing people in Boise, an online dating
          photographer can help.
      - question: What are the best photos for dating in Boise?
        answer: From our testing, people in Boise prefers photos that are authentic. This means no professional studio photos which have obviously been posed and edited. Instead, your photos should be taken outdoors in natural light, and they should focus on your charm, personality and confidence.
      - question: Why hire an online dating photographer?
        answer: Because every online dating app prioritizes photos. You could look like Brad Pitt in real life, but if your photos suck and people can't see that - then you're not going to be matching with many people. Most people don't have great photos. So we scrap together whatever old photos we can find, add in a few bathroom selfies and hope for the best. We know these awkward photos don't do us justice, but it's all we have. An online dating photographer will help showcase all your best features. They'll highlight your charisma, charm and confidence. The'll find all your best angles, help you look natural and deliver stunning photos that will stop people in their tracks.
