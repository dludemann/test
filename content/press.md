      One of the most common questions we get is, "Is dating photography a
      thing?" Yes, it is quite literally a thing and the best thing ever for
      someone in the dating game. If you are unable to find the match that you
      want or are being looked over by women or men even on an app like Tinder,
      then it's important to take a close hard look at those dating photos.
