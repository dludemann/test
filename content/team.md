      - title: Shane White
        subtitle: Founder
        description: >-
          Shane’s passion for The Match Artist started when Nick shot some
          photos of Shane and suggested he upload them to his Tinder profile.
          Many dates later, he had a girlfriend and thought online dating photos
          could be helpful to other guys. In addition to being full time at The
          Match Artist, Shane is also the founder of a software company and a
          popular wedding DJ company. He enjoys piloting his plane and spending
          time with his wife.

          expression coaching. Outside of coaching guys to look their best in
          photos, he enjoys cooking, playing piano, and spending time with his
