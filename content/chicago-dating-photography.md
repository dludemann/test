        "Before getting pics taken by The Match Artist, I was getting 2-3 Tinder
        matches a week. After getting new high value pictures from The Match
        Artist and tweaking my bio I was getting over 5 matches per day with
        really great girls. The results truly speak for themselves."

        I was hesitant to invest in what I thought were glorified glamour shots,
        and worried that the results would be a little cheesy... but I was also
        fed up with hours of mediocre results with my mirror selfies and cropped
        group photos... I was intimidated going into it but that was immediately
        alleviated. They did a great job of making me relaxed, comfortable, and
        confident.  And the results... WOW! Way more matches and likes, but the
        increase in the follow-through rate was the noticeable difference. No
        more expired Bumble matches waiting for that first outreach!

    faqs:
      - question: Should I hire an online dating photographer?
        answer: >-
          Photos are arguably the most important part of your dating profile.
          When you upgrade your photos, you upgrade your matches. If you want to
          meet even more amazing people in Dallas, our online dating
          photographers can help you get there.
      - question: What are the best photos for dating in Chicago?
        answer: >-
          From our testing and research, people prefer photos that are
          authentic. It may sound obvious, but crafting an authentic and
          eye-catching online dating profile is actually harder than it sounds.
          This means no professional studio photos which have obviously been
          posed and edited. Instead, your photos should be taken in more natural
          settings and give people a sense of your personality, hobbies, and
          confidence. The best online dating photos are the ones where you look
          real, confident, and and intriguing enough catch someone's attention.
          If that sounds daunting, we can help.
      - question: Why hire an online dating photographer?
        answer: >-
          Because every online dating app prioritizes photos. People make split
          second decisions based on photos alone. You could look like Brad Pitt
          in real life, but if your photos don't show that, you're not going to
          get the matches you're wanting. Reality is, most people don't have
          great photos. So we scrap together whatever old photos we can find,
          add in a car selfie, and hope for the best. We know these awkward
          photos don't do us justice, but it's all we have. Instead of
          scrounging for photos, what if you had almost too many to choose from?
          Our online dating photographers will capture photos that do you
          justice and bring out your best features. They'll help you create a
          profile that you're proud of and that stands out from the rest. The'll
          find all your best angles, help you look natural, and deliver enough
          photos to fill up your dating profile and then some.
