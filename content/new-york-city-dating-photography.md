        Before getting pics taken by The Match Artist, I was getting 2-3 tinder
        matches a week. After getting new high value pictures from The Match
        Artist and tweaking my bio I was getting over 5 matches per day with
        really great girls. The results truly speak for themselves.

      - question: Should I hire a photographer for dating apps?
        answer: >-
          Hiring a photographer for dating apps is highly recommended if you're
          serious about making a strong first impression. Professional photos
          can drastically increase the quality of your profile by highlighting
          your best features in a flattering light and setting. With the
          competitive nature of dating in a bustling city like New York, having
          standout profile pictures can significantly increase your chances of
          attracting meaningful connections.
      - question: Which dating app works best in NYC?
        answer: >-
          The best dating app in NYC depends on your personal preferences and
          what you're looking for in a relationship. For those seeking a wide
          range of potential matches, apps like Tinder and Bumble are popular
          choices due to their large user bases and straightforward interfaces.
          For more relationship-focused dating, apps like Hinge and Coffee Meets
          Bagel offer profiles that allow for deeper insights into potential
          matches.
      - question: Are professional Tinder photos worth it?
        answer: >-
          Professional Tinder photos are definitely worth the investment,
          especially in a highly competitive dating market like New York City.
