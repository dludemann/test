        I was hesitant to invest in what I thought were glorified glamour shots,
        and worried that the results would be a little cheesy... but I was also
        fed up with hours of mediocre results with my mirror selfies and cropped
        group photos... I was intimidated going into it but that was immediately
        alleviated. They did a great job of making me relaxed, comfortable, and
        confident.  And the results... WOW! Way more matches and likes, but the
        increase in the follow-through rate was the noticeable difference. No
        more expired Bumble matches waiting for that first outreach!

        Before getting pics taken by The Match Artist, I was getting 2-3 tinder
        matches a week. After getting new high value pictures from The Match
        Artist and tweaking my bio I was getting over 5 matches per day with
        really great girls. The results truly speak for themselves.
