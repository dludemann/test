  title: Facebook Dating Is Here
  page_description: >-
    It's about time that Facebook enters the dating market. I've set up a profile and have begun exploring the newest dating platform. Not many are using it regularly quite yet, but I'd imagine it will be more functional as more start swiping. The layout is much like other common apps with a swipe right/left, as well as Instagram connectivity.

It's about time that Facebook enters the dating market. I've set up a profile and have begun exploring the newest dating platform. Not many are using it regularly quite yet, but I'd imagine it will be more functional as more start swiping. The layout is much like other common apps with a swipe right/left, as well as Instagram connectivity.

The intriguing features come with how the service is connected to Facebook. While swiping through profiles, you can see if there are any mutual friends in common, which mutual groups you're in, as well as local events you are both interested in. I find this to be easier to potentially connect with someone because you're seeing what someone is interested in outside of just building a profile.
