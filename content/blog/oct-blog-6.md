Let’s get started!

## What is Online Flirting?

[Online flirting](https://www.wikihow.com/Flirt-Online) is when you use digital interactions to express romantic or sexual interest in someone. It’s how you show a woman you’re attracted to them without in-person contact. To show you want to be more than friends.

Most online flirting occurs on dating apps. However, it can also happen via social media like Instagram, over text, or video chats. Alternatively, you may virtually meet each other as members of a forum or on message boards.

Because online flirting lacks the intimacy of in-person flirting, online flirters must rely on the written word to convey their attraction. Online flirting often includes banter - carefully crafting your words - emojis and video chats to replace physical cues.

It’s all about creating a balance. Engaging and intriguing, teasing but not going too far, and keeping the conversation fresh and exciting. With online dating, online flirting is an essential skill for moving the ‘talking stage’ to a proper date!

## How to Flirt With a Girl Online

[Flirting online](https://thematchartist.com/blog/how-to-flirt-with-a-girl) is a delicate balancing act. You need to showcase humor while showing a genuine interest. Tone can be difficult to interpret through just texts alone. Here are some tips to make sure you nail those first few conversations.

### Make a Playful Joke About Their Profile

Profiles are a great starting point to initiate conversation. They’re the first thing the other person sees when they connect with you on a dating app. It’s the ideal jumping-off point and can quickly let you in on another person's style and interests.

Make a joke that shows you’ve read her profile and paid attention. Examples could be commenting on a fun photo or joking about an unusual interest or hobby. Look for signs that your jokes are landing, like longer replies and witty retorts.

Remember, if a girl’s profile is the first thing you notice, it’s the first thing she’ll notice about you, too! If your photos don’t reflect your appearance, try booking a session with [The Match Artist](https://thematchartist.com/). Their professional photographers will help your pictures stand out, reflect the real you, and give you confidence.

### Pay Attention to Body Language, Even Online

While you can’t see body language through [text](https://thematchartist.com/blog/how-to-flirt-with-girls-over-text), you can notice cues in her written responses. Look at the length and tone of her messages - the effort she puts in - and use them to gauge her interest. A short response after a teasing joke could indicate that she felt the joke went too far and suggest she may prefer a more straightforward approach.

### Give Her a Genuine Compliment

A genuine, well-thought-out compliment can make a girl’s day! Avoid generic compliments that could apply to any girl and focus on something unique about her.

There are better ways than using the same old lines on every girl.

Compliments about something other than her looks are also greatly appreciated. Genuine charm is much more than tired and overused one-liners.

### Connect on Video Chat or Phone Calls If Possible

If your text flirting is going well, transition to video chats or phone calls. Calls make the interaction more personal and can help you better understand who you’re talking to. Video calls are also great for gauging body language and interest.

### Play a Fun Online Game

You’ll need to think carefully before trying this one, as some girls will not be interested in playing an online game. If you think she’d be into this, it can be an excellent way to break the ice and get to know each other. Competitive games can often spark a bit of banter and are something you can look forward to replaying to get one back.

### Show Off Your Sense of Humor

It’s not just a cliche — girls like guys that [make them laugh](https://www.menshealth.com/trending-news/a19542164/why-chicks-dig-funny-guys/). Share funny anecdotes with her, engage in playful teasing, and make witty observations. Memes are a simple way to get the ball rolling and are super easy to send.

Using humor will help break the ice and make your online conversations fun. Tell her about some entertaining past predicaments you’ve got yourself into. What stories can you share?

### Make Your Intention Clear

Don’t mislead girls during the flirting phase — you need to make your intentions clear. If you’re looking for something casual, be clear about it.

If you’re hoping for a match leading to love and marriage, say it! That way, you won’t waste her time, and everyone will be on the same page about what they want in life. Simply put, be upfront.

### Use Emojis During Chat

Using emojis is an easy way to convey tone in your messages. They also add a playful note to your conversations. There’s even [some evidence](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-myths-sex/201908/people-who-use-more-emojis-have-more-sex-and-get-more-dates) that people who use emojis get more dates!

## Mistakes to Avoid While Flirting with Girls Online

We’ve gone over what to do, but what about what *not* to do? There are quite a few pitfalls to avoid when flirting with girls online. It’s easy to inadvertently ruin a connection by saying the wrong thing.

### Don't Ask Prying Questions

Don’t ask too many invasive questions early on. While it’s okay to have dealbreakers like whether you’re looking for something casual or serious, the more prying questions can wait. Keep things light and fun as you get to know her — there’ll be time later for the serious stuff.

### Don't Be a Narcissist

Ensure you’re someone who only talks about themselves! These people are known as [conversational narcissists](https://www.linkageinc.com/leadership-insights/you-might-be-a-conversational-narcissist-and-not-even-know-it-heres-how-to-tell/#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%9Cconversational%20narcissist%E2%80%9D%20was,keep%20the%20focus%20on%20themselves.), and it's a surefire way to kill a connection. Ask her questions about herself, and make sure you’re genuinely listening. Don’t just wait to talk about you!

The sooner you discover your shared interests, the easier the conversation will be. Having a similar worldview and sharing some of the same ideas is essential in any relationship.

If you’re struggling to think of questions, try The Match Artist’s [list](https://thematchartist.com/blog/what-is-21-questions-to-ask-a-girl) of the best questions to ask a girl! They’re a great way to get the ball rolling.

### Never Send Indecent Photos

This should be self-evident. Never, *ever* send unsolicited indecent photos. It’s not only rude; it can even be considered harassment. Consent is vital, so make sure you always maintain appropriate boundaries.

If she suggests swapping spicy pictures and is into it, that is different. But that’s unlikely to happen at the beginning of the flirting stage!

### Don't Compare Her to Other Girls

Comparing her to other women can make her feel undervalued — even if you think it's a favorable comparison. It will also make her wonder what you might say about her to another girl. Instead, focus on what makes her unique without making comparisons.

### Steer Clear of Insulting Humor

Drawing from our experience, there’s a fine line between playful teasing and insulting humor! Keep things light-hearted, and don’t include anything insulting. Insulting humor is just too risky, and rude comments are unnecessary.

Sometimes, the jokes land - but it’s easy to go too far and completely ruin the vibe. A mild, playful joke about quirky hobbies is one thing. Flat-out insults or jokes about her appearance are a definite no-no!

### Don't Push It Too Much

Take some free advice - don’t push too much, especially at the beginning. Pay attention to her responses. If she’s coming across as disinterested, you won’t win her over by bombarding her with messages.

If she doesn’t respond to your flirting, you must accept this and move on to someone receptive. Within reason, work on the conversation, but know when to stop. After all, your time is precious, and you’re better off spending it on someone who wants to chat with you!

### Don't Try to Be Something That You are Not

Based on our firsthand experience, [authenticity](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/rediscovering-love/202302/whats-your-baggage)is a critical factor in online dating. Present yourself honestly, and you’ll be far more likely to make a genuine connection and feel more relaxed and confident.

Girls can sense when a guy is trying to brag or present himself as something other than what he is, and it’s a major turn-off. Being yourself doesn’t require a lot of effort, and the right one will love the authentic you!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How Do You Flirt with a Girl Without Being Obvious?

Be subtle — focus on getting to know her with light, friendly messages. Don’t directly state your romantic intentions, but use humor and witty banter to draw her into conversation. Ensure your compliments feel like a natural part of the conversation and are not over the top.

### How Can I Subtly Flirt Over Text with a Girl?

Subtle flirting involves being friendly, playful, and complimentary without being over the top. Humor is an excellent tool for subtle flirting and an easy way to break the ice and create a lighthearted dynamic.

### How Can I Flirt With a Girl I Have Just Met?
