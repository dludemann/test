Let’s dive right in!

## What Is the Blue Star on Tinder?

In brief, the blue star on the social media platform Tinder is an icon that allows you to send a Super Like to another user. Everyone can access Super Likes, as long as you’re willing to pay for the feature.

Unlike the standard gold heart, or Like, Super Likes are a way to let another user know that you’re especially interested in being a little more than just friends…! Whether you’re looking for a hookup or marriage, a Super Like could be your foot in the door.

Free users will have access to one Super Like per day. If you have upgraded your account to Tinder Plus, Tinder Gold, or Tinder Platinum, you’ll be able to use five free Super Likes per day.

Note that these don’t roll over, so you’ll only ever have one a day, or five a day.

### Introduction to Tinder’s Super Like

Tinder’s [Super Like feature](https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/1/9431383/tinder-super-like-available-now) was introduced in December 2015 as a way to express heightened interest in people’s profiles. The idea was that singles may be more likely to respond if they knew that you were *incredibly* interested, ie, less likely to ghost…!

If you wish to send a Super Like, you can either tap the blue star icon in the bottom section of another user’s profile, or Swipe Up.

Super Likes are a bold move, signifying that the other user has caught your attention beyond the average profile.

### What does the Blue Star Mean on Tinder?

If you see a blue star notification next to someone’s name on Tinder, that signals that you’ve Super Liked their profile. Seeing a blue star on your own profile indicates that another user has Super Liked you.

Clicking on the blue star button at the bottom of another users’ profile will allow you to send them a Super Like.

### Blue Star on Tinder: A Deeper Look

Diving deeper into the workings of the blue star on Tinder, it’s important to understand its role in the overall Tinder algorithm.

Super Likes aren’t just about showcasing interest, they’re a tool to boost your visibility and attract potential matches. When you Super Like another user, a blue border will appear around your profile in the match deck, as well as a blue star icon, and they’ll receive a notification.

Notably, Super Likes are limited, unless you have a Tinder Plus, Tinder Gold, or Tinder Platinum subscription. These premium accounts offer free Super Likes, along with other features like profile Boosts, or Tinder Top Picks, which may help ramp up your dating game by presenting you with high-profile matches.

## The Functionality of Super Like

Super Likes are not just another feature, they’re a powerful tool in your dating arsenal that could increase your chances of making a match.

Understanding how to use Super Likes is essential to maximize your Tinder experience, potentially get you more matches, and dates!

### How Does Super Like Work?

If you decide that you really want to put a bit of extra effort in, sending a Super Like will instantly let the other person know that you’ve Liked their profile. This is a little different from a normal Like, as you’ll only know that someone Liked your profile if they Swipe Right on you, too, and you match.

When you send a Super Like, your profile will appear in the other person’s match queue with a blue border, accompanied by a blue star. If the other person then Swipes Right on you, it’ll create an instant match, allowing you to chat and potentially make a connection.

If you receive a Super Like from someone, you’ll see their profile in your match queue with the same blue border and blue star. You may also see that you’ve been Super Liked in your in-app notifications (if you have them turned on).

### How to Use Super Like Correctly

As you only have access to one Super Like per day, if you purchase them (the more you purchase will give you a slight discount), or if you have one of Tinder’s premium profiles (you have access to five a week), it’s important to be selective with your Super Likes.

After all, your Super Likes should only be given out in the case that you’re *really* interested in someone else, and can see it leading to a worthwhile connection.

Super Likes are a declaration of elevated interest. Therefore, only use them on profiles that *truly* attract you and match your interests! It’ll also work out a bit cheaper for you…!

### Can I Undo a Super Like?

Unfortunately, if you have a free account and send a Super Like by accident, or if you have a change of heart, there is [no way](https://www.wikihow.com/Undo-a-Super-Like-on-Tinder#:~:text=Is%20it%20possible%20to%20undo%20a%20Super%20Like%3F,-%7B%22smallUrl%22%3A&amp;text=Yes%E2%80%94as%20long%20as%20you,its%20own%20after%201%20day.) to unsend a Super Like. You can always unmatch with the person you’ve Super Liked if you end up matching later.

This just highlights why it’s important to consider each Super Like carefully!

If you have a paid subscription, you may have the option to undo your last action, so you can undo a Super Like if you like someone by accident.

## Identifying Super Likes

Super Likes are one of the things Tinder introduced with the intention to highlight your profile and draw the recipients’ attention to you.

But if you’ve been Super Liked, how can you tell? Let’s take a closer look.

### How Do You Know If Someone Super Liked You?

When someone Super Likes your profile, a notification will pop up on your phone from the Tinder app. When you open the app, you’ll find the person who Super Liked you in your match deck. Their profile will stand out, framed with a bright blue outline and a star icon.

Remember that the Super Like feature is a bold action, indicating that someone is especially interested in your profile. It’s more than just a regular Swipe Right; it’s a way of making a statement and showing heightened interest.

### What Happens When You Get Super Liked on Tinder?

When you get Super Liked on Tinder, it’s like getting a digital nudge. Once you’ve been Super Liked, the ball is in your court.

You can Swipe Right and match (which will allow you <a href="https://thematchartist.com/tinder/best-first-text-tinder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to send messages</a>), Swipe Left and pass, or even send a Super Like back (though, since these are limited, you may just want to go ahead and match normally with the other user).

Getting a Super Like can boost your dating app experience and potentially lead to a new relationship.

Remember, Tinder is the leader among dating apps for a reason: it’s an online platform for connection, conversation, and — for many — finding love.

## How to React to a Super Like

Super Likes are extremely flattering to receive, but how you react to them is totally up to you.

If you’re mutually attracted to the person who has Super Liked you, Swipe Right and start messaging!

However, just because you’ve been Super Liked by others doesn’t mean that you’re under any obligation to match. Sometimes they just might not be your type! If so, Swipe Left and continue with your Tinder journey.

If someone has sent you a Super Like and you Swipe Right on them, consider <a href="https://thematchartist.com/tinder/why-do-guys-not-message-first-on-tinder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sending the first message</a>! After all, it will have taken some effort for them to Super Like you!

## How to Get More Super Likes

Regular Tinder users get one Super Like per day to give out, but Tinder Plus, Gold, and Platinum members get five. You can also purchase extra from the Tinder store if you need more (the more you buy, the cheaper it is).

If you’re looking to receive more Super Likes, the best method is to optimize your profile. This includes making sure you’ve fully filled out your profile, have a short but interesting bio with conversation starters, and have adjusted your settings.

However, above all, the best way to make your profile stand out is to ensure you’re using [good, high-quality and recent photos](https://nypost.com/2022/07/18/experts-swear-these-tips-for-your-dating-profile-will-increase-matches-by-93/).

## Unraveling Tinder Symbols

Navigating Tinder can feel like learning a new language with all its unique symbols and icons. Luckily, we’re on hand to alleviate your worries.

### What Does the Blue Tick Mean on Tinder?

The blue tick means a profile is [photo verified](https://www.help.tinder.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034941812-Photo-Verification).

This means they have made use of the Tinder facial verification system to verify that the pictures posted on their profile are actually of them.

### Interpreting the Gold Diamond Symbol on Tinder

The gold diamond icon is a special symbol that appears only to Tinder Gold and Tinder Platinum subscribers. This icon represents Tinder’s Top Picks feature.

Every day, Tinder curates a list of potential matches tailored to your profile and preferences. These Top Picks are profiled with a gold diamond symbol, setting them apart from regular profiles and indicating that they might be particularly compatible with you, according to Tinder’s algorithm.

### Deciphering Other Tinder Symbols: Blue Border, Black Heart, and More

As we’ve mentioned, a blue border around a profile image indicates someone has been Super Liked by you. If you receive a Super Like, the sender’s profile will also be highlighted with a blue border on your screen, with an added blue star to confirm their interest.

The black heart icon is something you get access to with a [Tinder Platinum](https://tinder.com/feature/platinum) subscription. It indicates when someone has already liked your picture, giving you the chance to match with them right away.

Other symbols include the purple lightning bolt, which represents the Boost feature. Activating a Boost propels your profile to one of the top spots in your area for 30 minutes, increasing your visibility tenfold.

## Super Likes and Tinder Top Picks

Tinder offers a ton of features to enhance user experiences, and Super Likes and Top Picks are part of that. The Super Like allows your profile to stand out, while Top Picks curates a list of profiles that you might like.

### Understanding Tinder Top Picks

Top Picks is a premium feature available to Tinder Gold and Tinder Platinum users.

Every day, Tinder’s algorithm curates a personalized list of profiles for you, placing a gold diamond symbol on them to indicate their Top Pick status. This list is based on information in your profile, including your swiping patterns, likes, and interests.

The intention is to present you with profiles that you’re likely to find particularly attractive, save you time, and boost your chances of finding a match.

### How to Be a Top Pick on Tinder

Tinder’s algorithm is responsible for choosing your top picks. It uses the information on your profile — including your location, bio and profile pictures — to choose Top Picks for you.

There’s no one way to become a Top Pick, but having a well thought-out profile with great quality photos is a good way to up your chances of being a top pick.

### Does a Blue Star Mean in Top Picks?

If a profile in your Top Picks has a blue star, it indicates you’ve Super Liked that profile. However, getting a Super Like doesn’t necessarily mean that profile will appear in your Top Picks, as the features are separate.

### What Does the Gold Diamond Mean on Tinder?

The gold diamond symbol on Tinder is only available to Tinder Gold and Tinder Platinum subscribers. It presents a curated list of profiles that are highlighted with a gold diamond, allowing premium users a list of highly compatible potential matches.

## Key Takeaways

Tinder Super Likes (the blue star icon) are a feature on Tinder that let you demonstrate added interest in a profile. It’s a great way to let someone know their profile really stands out to you.

When someone is Super Liked, they will get a notification, and your profile will appear in their match queue with a bright blue border and blue star. This feature helps to grab the attention of the user, letting them know you’re especially interested.

You can either Swipe Up or tap the blue star to Super Like a profile.

Make sure you only Super Like on profiles you are genuinely interested in, as you only have one a day with a free account and can’t undo the action, unless you have a paid subscription!

You can choose to respond to Super Likes based on how you feel about the profile. You’re not obligated to match with someone just because they Super Liked you.

If you’re looking to attract more Super Likes, make sure you optimize your profile with a great, comprehensive bio, conversation starters, and more.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I see who Super Liked Me on Tinder without paying?

Absolutely! There is no cost to see who Super Liked you, and Tinder will send you a notification. The person who Super Liked you will appear in your swipe deck, their profile surrounded by a border and star.

Even if you’re <a href="https://thematchartist.com/tinder/how-to-use-tinder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using the free version of Tinder</a>, you’ll still know who Super Liked you without needing to spend money.

### Can you undo a Super Like on Tinder?

Once you’ve Swiped Up or hit the blue star, the Super Like is sent and cannot be taken back, unless you’re on a paid subscription.

This is something to bear in mind when navigating the app, as it’s easy to accidentally Super Like a profile if you’re not careful.

On the other hand, if you end up matching with someone you Super Liked by mistake, you can choose to unmatch with them.

### How long does a Super Like last on Tinder?

A Super Like lasts until the recipient either Swipes Left, dismissing the Super Like, or Swipes Right to create a match. This gives the recipient plenty of time to view your profile and decide whether or not to reciprocate.

The Super Like feature is a great, easy way to express interest and grab the attention of potential matches, but remember, the quality of your conversation and your profile itself will have the most significant impact on your success with the app.
