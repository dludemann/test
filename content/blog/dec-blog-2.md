## How Should Your Online Dating Profile Look?

While there’s a lot of [information](https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/life/sex-and-relationships/15-ways-to-make-your-online-dating-profile-stand-out-from-the-pack-1-118673) out there about what makes a [great dating profile](https://thematchartist.com/blog/dating-app-profile), in our experience authenticity is the most important. Focus on what is actually important to you - you want to attract a man or woman who you are genuinely compatible with, not one who is attracted to a fake version of you!

We highly recommend you blend [high-quality photos](https://thematchartist.com/blog/dating-app-pictures) with a bio that does a good job of highlighting unique qualities and describing hobbies and passions. Expressing relationship goals and revealing a sense of humor is also important for attracting attention from compatible matches.

### How Does the Algorithm of an Online Dating Profile Work?

While algorithms differ between dating apps, in general, the [algorithms](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-dating-app-works-algorithm-secrets-unveiled-akhil-khandelwal/) try to take into account your interests, preferences, and interactions to help make matches. Algorithms work on prioritizing the profiles of people that they deem to be compatible with you, increasing your chances of making a connection. This is why authenticity and truthfulness are so important - if you try to be someone you’re not, you’re unlikely to attract truly compatible matches!

## Dating App Profile Examples to Inspire You

So, what about some clear examples? Each of the below profiles is a great way to showcase what’s important to you and attract like-minded people. Just make sure you choose one that truly reflects who you are!

### The "Ask About Me" Profile

This profile is perfect for creating a sense of intrigue and curiosity. You want to encourage other daters to initiate conversations and ask questions about your unique experiences. When making this type of profile, don’t give too much away - for example, include a picture of you participating in an unusual hobby but don’t include information about it in your bio! This is a great method for engaging potential partners in meaningful conversation.

### The Playful Adventurer Profile

Showcasing personal interests is key to this profile. Include plenty of pictures of your adventures, travels, and interests. This profile is all about demonstrating openness to new experiences and attracting adventurous daters.

### The Thoughtful Intellectual Profile

Not everyone is into extreme sports or travel, and that’s ok! The thoughtful intellectual profile is perfect for reflecting individual personality through a love for books and other intellectual pursuits. Include your areas of intellectual interest in your bio - don’t be afraid to share your passion!

### The Creative Spirit Profile

If artistic hobbies and creative pursuits are your passion, this is the profile for you! Whether you’re a writer, artist, or musician, demonstrate your creativity with a bio and pictures that show your imagination and innovation.

### The Fitness Enthusiast Profile

The ideal profile for gym junkies! If health and fitness are your passion, make this clear in your profile. Include pictures of yourself in the gym, on hikes, or engaging in other healthy pursuits. This is perfect for attracting matches who also value physical health and energetic adventures! Just remember - keep the shirtless gym mirror selfies to a minimum!

### The Culinary Explorer Profile

Calling all foodies! If you love cooking and trying new cuisines, make this clear in your profile! You don’t want to end up matching with a picky eater, after all! Share pictures of yourself at adventurous restaurants and emphasize your love of culinary adventures!

### The Travel Buff Profile

If travel is your life, make sure your profile reflects this! Include pictures of your global adventures and yourself chilling on exotic beaches, and include details in the bio of your favorite places to visit. This way you can draw in matches who are on the same page and value adventure and travel.

### The Music Lover Profile

Whether you’re a musician or just have a deep connection to music, include this information in your profile. You can attract daters who are into the same music scene and who place the same value on music in their lives.

### The Animal Lover Profile

If your fur baby is the most important person in your life, they need to be included in your profile! This option is great for highlighting a genuine love for animals and appealing to men or women who feel the same way. Include pictures of you with your pet or engaging with wildlife conservation, and ensure your bio reflects your views on conservation and the environment.

### The Comedic Personality Profile

Humor is arguably the [most important trait](https://theconversation.com/online-dating-humour-matters-more-than-good-looks-but-immigrants-struggle-with-local-jokes-131836) people look for on dating sites, so if you’re funny, make the most of it! Make sure your profile reveals a sense of humor through witty comments in your bio and funny anecdotes. This can make the difference in whether people swipe left or swipe right on your profile!

## How do I write a hot dating profile?

Writing an attractive dating profile is all about balance - presenting an honest and genuine self-image as well as highlighting unique qualities that make you special. It’s always attractive when someone knows what they want, so expressing relationship goals upfront is the ideal way to confidently signal your intentions.

Conveying sincerity and authenticity in your description ensures your matches have compatibility with you, and creates a foundation for meaningful connection. A great profile is the first step to turning a match into messages and messaging into a first date! We also want to stress that we recommend filling out every section in your profile - don’t leave anything out! A profile where everything is blank is very offputting, as it suggests you haven’t put in effort.

## 4 Tips to Perfect Your Profile

Through our practical knowledge, we’ve discovered that there are four important considerations when writing the perfect profile. Getting these details right can boost your profile views and increase your chances of quality matches.

### 1\. Talk About Positive Attributes and Qualities About Yourself

This is not the time to be self-deprecating! Emphasize your positive attributes and qualities - like being adventurous, funny, or genuine. Try describing hobbies and passions that reflect these traits instead of just stating them - it will come across as more natural.

### 2\. Describe the Type of Person You are Looking for in a Partner

Don’t just talk about yourself - be specific about what you’re looking for. List the qualities, preferences, and values that are important to you - this will help with attracting compatible matches and engaging potential partners in conversation.

### 3\. Avoid Cliches and Be Authentic with Your Descriptions

It’s easy to accidentally use cliches in your online dating bio, but do your best to avoid them! Instead, choose authenticity in your descriptions - make sure they really reflect who you are. Try expressing relationship goals and personal interests that truly matter to you - this authenticity is more likely to attract genuine connections over shallow hookups.

### 4\. Mention Something You Enjoy Doing in Your Spare Time

Connecting over interests and hobbies is the ideal way to make connections. Share stories about your likes and dislikes, as well as your hobbies and adventures. This could be as simple as the books, music, and movies you enjoy - the idea is for your potential dates to get an idea of who you are. This is ideal for demonstrating openness to new experiences and can help you find daters with similar interests.

## Visual Elements: Choosing the Right Photos

Although writing a good profile is key, the importance of choosing the right photos cannot be overstated! Humans are visual creatures, and like it or not, appearances matter.

### Selecting the Best Photographs for Your Profile

Choosing the best photographs for your profile is an art form! You don’t want to choose too many selfies, but you don’t want too many group pictures with your friends either! Ideally, you want a nice blend of photographs that highlight your interests and lifestyle, while still capturing what you look like.

If you’re finding it hard to find pictures that you feel truly reflect who you are, why not engage the services of The Match Artist? Their [professional photographers](https://thematchartist.com/blog/should-i-get-professional-photos-for-online-dating) ensure that your profile pictures are as good as they can possibly be, and their unique facial expression coaching will ensure your pictures reflect the true you.

### Visual Storytelling in Online Dating

Visual storytelling in online dating is essential, and this concept is at the heart of The Match Artists’s philosophy. They believe in using photos to show who you are as a person, using images as a means of illustrating lifestyle choices and describing hobbies and passions. For example, if you love kayaking, make sure you include a picture of yourself fully immersed in your passion - this passion will come across in the photos and is key to attracting compatible matches.
