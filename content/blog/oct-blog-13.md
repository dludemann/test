## What Is Text Flirting?

Text flirting is a form of [romantic conversation](https://www.thecut.com/article/how-to-flirt-over-text-tips-and-flirty-texts-examples.html) that happens via text messages. It’s a way to showcase your wit and charm as well as your sense of fun through playful messages. Text flirting relies on the written word, so each joke, compliment, and emoji must be carefully considered to ensure you use the right tone and that you properly show your interest.

Timing is an essential factor in text flirting. You need to know when to send a message designed to make a woman smile, and when to leave them wanting more.

Text flirting can build anticipation and curiosity for in-person interactions. It’s also a great way to show your attraction to someone using only your words.

Text flirting relies on paying attention to details — you need to be aware of the other person’s mood and interest so you can correctly gauge their level of interest. A great text flirting experience can boost the confidence of both parties and make the transition to an in-person date go smoothly.

## How to Flirt With Girls Over Text

[Flirting with girls](https://thematchartist.com/blog/how-to-flirt-with-a-girl) over text is a great way to slowly build a relationship in a fun, low-stakes manner. It’s a great way to capture their interest and pique their curiosity for an in-person date.

### Starting with a Strong Opener

First things first — what are the best opening lines for texting? Your first message sets the tone for your conversation, so you want to ensure it gets the girl’s attention.

Your first step is to decide what you want the tone of the conversation to be. Do you want it to be funny, cute, or a little racy? Once you’ve decided on the tone, then you can go about crafting an opener. Remember to use her name often in conversation for a personal touch.

### Using Emojis to Convey Emotion

Emojis are great, but how often should you use emojis when flirting? They’re good when used sparingly to convey emotions, and they’re also a great way to add some playfulness to the conversation and [lighten the tone](https://www.michigandaily.com/opinion/why-you-can-judge-someone-based-on-their-emoji-usage/).

Avoid overuse of emojis, though, as too many can make your texts seem juvenile!

### Compliments: Genuine and Heartfelt

So, when is it appropriate to send compliments over text? A good rule of thumb is to send compliments whenever they’re genuine, kind, and heartfelt.

Compliments shouldn’t just be random — use them as examples to show you’ve paid attention to a girl’s life, personality, and interests.

### Playful Teasing: Finding the Balance

Playful teasing is a great way to break the ice, but it’s important not to take it too far. Pay close attention to her responses to make sure she’s into the teasing. And how do you transition from playful teasing to deeper conversations?

This can be a bit more complex — make sure you mix your teasing conversation with some more serious topics so that she doesn’t just see you as a joker.

### Asking Open-Ended Questions

Asking [questions](https://thematchartist.com/blog/what-is-21-questions-to-ask-a-girl) that require a detailed response is a great way to get to know her better. When you ask questions is important, too. But why is timing important in text conversations?

Basically, if you ask the deep, open-ended questions too early on, it can feel overwhelming and too much, and cause the girl to shut down. Slowly building up to a deeper conversation with light-hearted teasing is the best way to go.

### Building Anticipation for the Next Meetup

Although the talking stage is important, you’re ideally hoping to transition to in-person dates at some point. But when should you transition from texting to a phone call or meeting in person?

Once you’ve moved past the initial playful teasing stage and have started discussing more serious topics, this is also a good time to focus on building anticipation for an in-person meeting.

One to two weeks of talking is usually seen as the [optimum](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/love-sex/relationships/a30999011/meet-dating-app-how-long/) amount of time before moving on to the next stage.

### Using GIFs and Memes for Humor

Being funny while flirting is a vital strategy for winning a girl’s heart, but what role does humor play in text-based flirting? When you’re flirting over text, you need to rely mostly on your words to convey your sense of humor.

This is also where memes and GIFs come in. Used sparingly, they can be a great way to showcase the comedy you enjoy and create shared jokes.

## Maintaining a Natural Flow

One of the biggest questions everyone has about text flirting is how can you ensure the conversation flows naturally. Make sure you don’t force the conversation, and focus on topics you’re genuinely interested in. If you’re enjoying the process of text flirting, you won’t have to force things — it will come naturally.

## Benefits of Flirting With Girls Over Text

In today’s digital world, flirting with girls over text is a common part of the dating experience. It’s a great way to begin a relationship and add a personal touch to your conversations.

### Convenience and Comfort

One of the biggest benefits of flirting over [text or online](https://thematchartist.com/blog/how-to-flirt-with-girls-online) is that it’s just so convenient! Of course, even if you’re feeling nervous, texting doesn’t show it, so you can still engage in conversation in convenience and comfort.

### Building Anticipation

Texting is a great way to build anticipation for future interactions and dates. It’s easy to maintain interest in an upcoming meeting when you can send flirty messages to each other in the lead-up to the date.

### Crafting Thoughtful Responses

Because texting gives you more time to respond than flirting in real life, you’ve got time to craft considered, thoughtful responses.

### Reduced Initial Pressure

Texting is lower pressure than in-person interactions. This enables everyone to feel more comfortable and relaxed.

### Maintaining Mystery

When flirting, how can you maintain intrigue and mystery in your conversations? Text flirting is great for this, as it’s easy to arouse someone’s curiosity by slowly revealing personal details.

### Enhanced Creativity

Text flirting lets you be creative — you’ve got time to think through your responses and have fun with them. Using emojis and memes is a great way to add a personal touch to your texts.

### Strengthening Connections

Text flirting is an excellent way to strengthen your connections, but how can you gauge her interest level through texts? Make sure you pay careful attention to her responses to ensure she’s engaging with your messages. If her responses are brief or uninterested, it’s a sign you might need to change tactics.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid While Flirting With a Girl Over Text

So, what are common mistakes to avoid when flirting over text? Text flirting may be lower pressure and less nerve-wracking than in-person flirting, but there are still some common mistakes you should watch out for!

### Avoid Triple Text

Double texts are okay in moderation, but you want to avoid triple texting. Give her time and space to respond to the texts you send — anything else can seem desperate.

## Misusing or Overusing Emojis

Using emojis in the wrong context can make you appear out of touch, and overusing emojis can make your messages look [cluttered and juvenile](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/emoji-etiquette-navigating-nuances-digital-expression-iroegbu/). Use them sparingly and when they add value to your messages so that they don’t overshadow your conversation.

### Being Too Forward or Aggressive

Knowing what you want is great, but nothing is worse than being too forward or aggressive. If you’re not sure what topics are safe to broach when flirting over text, keep in mind that you’re trying to keep things lighthearted. More serious topics like work and politics can wait for in-person meetings.

### Not Respecting Boundaries

So, how do you maintain respect and boundaries in text conversations? And how do you recover from a misunderstood message or joke? The answer to both of these is the same — pay attention to her responses!

If she seems uncomfortable with the direction of the conversation or the level of intimacy, change tack immediately. If she appears upset by a joke, apologize and move on.

### Failing to Gauge Her Interest Level

But what are the signs she’s enjoying the text flirtation? If she’s enjoying the conversation, she’ll respond quickly and match your energy level. If she suddenly starts ignoring your texts or giving super brief responses, it’s a sign she’s not interested in the direction of the conversation.

### Don’t Ghost

Suddenly stopping responding to messages is not ok, and can give people [trust issues](https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/why-you-shouldnt-ghost-kpkn/). Be open and honest if you want to cease communication with someone. If you’ve met someone else or if you are no longer feeling the relationship, politely tell the other person.

### Relying on Clichés and Predictable Lines

Clichés and predictable lines make you come across as cheesy and insincere. Be authentic and original — it may take more effort, but you’ll be far more likely to attract her interest.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often should you text a girl to keep her interested?

This is variable — it depends on your mutual interest levels and how she’s responding. If you’re getting on well and she’s responding to everything you send, there isn’t a limit. If she’s not seeming particularly engaged, text her a couple of times a day but remember not to triple text.

### How can I make a girl laugh over text?

Our advice is to use jokes, memes, and emojis to make girls laugh. Try some lighthearted teasing, and try to establish some running inside jokes to create a connection.

### How to make a girl blush over text?

Sweet, sincere compliments are the way to go. Don’t be cheesy or over the top, and ensure your compliments are specific and show that you’ve paid attention to her.

### How do you start a conversation with a girl over text?

Focus on things you know about her. If you’ve seen her online dating profile, you can talk about something on there, such as her favorite music, song, hobbies, or movies — the list is endless!
