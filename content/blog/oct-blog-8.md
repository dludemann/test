## What is a Photogenic Face?

To put it simply, a person with a photogenic face is someone who has no trouble looking good in photos. Their face, hands, arms, shoulders, smile – anything the picture captures looks good, put-together, and not awkward.

## Why Am I Not Photogenic?

If you believe you are not photogenic, you may wonder why this is the case. There are a couple of reasons why this could be.

For one, the camera tends to emphasize flaws. People are generally more critical of themselves than others. Therefore, they may believe that they look worse than they actually do.

Drawing from our experience, you may believe you aren’t photogenic because you lack confidence and posing skills. These skills are crucial to making your photos appear natural and comfortable. Ultimately, whether or not you are photogenic often comes down to internal conflicts.

## Are Some People Born Photogenic?

So, are there people out there who are born photogenic? Or is no one truly photogenic? Must I work out three times a day and only choose the healthy option on the menu to look photogenic?

Some people are born with natural confidence and clear skin and are relaxed in front of the camera. These lucky people tend to appear more photogenic than others who do not possess these traits.

## Can You Become Photogenic?

Don’t fear! Just because you feel you are not photogenic now doesn’t mean you will never be. There are lots of ways to improve how you look in photos - essentially, you can [train yourself to be photogenic](https://thematchartist.com/blog/how-to-be-photogenic)!

Once you master posing, discover your best angles, and gain confidence, you can be just as photogenic as anyone else.

## Facial Features That Make People Look Photogenic

A few features can significantly contribute to how photogenic someone appears. While these do not strictly apply to everyone, many things can impact how photogenic a person is.

### Bone Structure

Your bone structure generally determines the entire shape of your face and body and is a significant component of being photogenic. While you cannot naturally change your bone structure, you can learn the best angles to suit your face.

### Symmetry and Proportions

Based on our first-hand experience, another aspect that can impact how photogenic you are is your symmetry and proportions. Again, you do not have to change these features. Instead, it’s possible to discover how to make them appear their best on camera.

### Facial Expressions

Facial expressions can contribute hugely to being photogenic and are something you can actively work on improving. Practicing a natural, photogenic smile will almost always elevate the quality of your photos.

### Body Language

Our findings show that your body language is another factor that will change how you appear in images. Working on your poses and the movement of your body is something that can make you much more photogenic.

### Body Posture

Like body language, your body posture is something you also want to consider. Standing up straight and with good posture will make you appear more confident and attractive in photos.

### Confidence

Last but certainly not least, you want to work on your confidence. People who are confident in photos generally look better, as this confidence shines through and makes them appear more attractive.

## How to Take Good Photos that Make You Look Photogenic

So, how can you take good photos that make you appear more photogenic? From headshots and portraits to mirror selfies and candids, we have all the best tips to appear more photogenic in photos.

### Choose the Right Angle

Are there specific angles that can enhance or diminish my photogenic qualities? Knowing your angles is extremely important when it comes to taking good photos. Take a moment to analyze your face – or even ask family or friends.

For example, do you look better from one side? Is a high angle better for your features? Consider your angles and practice taking photos with them in mind.

### Smile with Your Eyes

Based on our observations, your eyes always give away a fake smile. Dead, unsmiling eyes coupled with a false smile come off awkward at best and uncanny at worst. When smiling in photos, try to make it as genuine as possible and let the smile reach your eyes.

### Use Natural Light

Artificial lighting is often overly bright – this can highlight any blemishes on your face. Try to use natural lighting when taking photos. Natural lighting is not only less harsh, it also gives you a healthy glow.

### Get the Perfect Makeup

This is a big one for women: your makeup. Ensure you are not wearing thick layers of foundation, as this will appear cakey on camera. Ensure you blend your makeup seamlessly, as cameras often highlight harsh, unblended lines.

### Show Your Sincere Emotions

If you want to appear natural on camera, the best way is to let your raw emotions shine through. Want a picture of you smiling? Think about something that makes you happy, and let that authentic smile shine through!

### Hire a Professional Photographer

Despite what many people may think, professional photography is not just reserved for super special occasions. You can hire a professional photographer for any occasion!

For instance, more and more people are hiring professionals to take their [dating profile photos](https://thematchartist.com/blog/should-i-get-professional-photos-for-online-dating) to [increase their Tinder matches](https://thematchartist.com/blog/should-i-get-professional-photos-for-online-dating)! Thanks to the skills of professional photographers, you are likely to appear much better in these photos.

### Play with Poses

Have you ever taken a group photo and been shocked at how natural and nice their poses looked? Their faces just look right, their smiles all perfect! They’re unlikely professional models – so how do they pose so well?

The answer is practice. Take some time in front of the mirror and see what poses look the best for you. Think of how an artist or photographer takes time to get the right pose for their subject.

### Experiment with a Different Look

It may be time for a change of style. Play around and experiment with different fun looks and styles. These changes might impact how you feel about your appearance in photos.

Remember these words: confidence is key!

### Consider Your Posture

Based on our past experiences, posture is a crucial point to consider when taking pictures. The next time you step in front of a camera, try to be conscious of your posture.

Is your spine straight? Your chin lifted? These simple changes can make a world of difference and make your photos come out a whole lot better.

## Signs You're Not Photogenic

If you are wondering whether or not you are photogenic, there are sure signs you can look out for. But don’t just take our word for it! One Reddit user made [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/pxrb6/what_makes_someone_photogenic/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)on the topic, and countless comments from professional photographers rolled in.

The post's author asked: ‘What makes someone photogenic?’. Photographers replied with a range of answers. [One reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/pxrb6/comment/c3t36bv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) suggested, ‘The single most important feature that determines a person's level of being photogenic is their level of confidence. Self-esteem also plays a large role.’

Feeling self-conscious and awkward in photos indicates that you may not be photogenic. These feelings can be reflected in your appearance in photos. The good news is this is something that you can actively improve on.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does lighting play a role in how photogenic I appear?

You may think you’re naturally unphotogenic, but lousy lighting may be the culprit. Try taking photos in natural light and practicing from angles that do not cast unflattering shadows on your face.

### Could my posture or facial expressions be affecting my photos?

Your posture or facial expressions can affect the outcome of your photos. In fact, they almost always will have a huge influence on them. Try to have good posture, a straight spine, and natural facial expressions in photos.

### Why am I pretty but not photogenic?

You can be beautiful in real life but still have photos of yourself continuously appearing unflattering. As mentioned, the issue could be lighting, bad posture, or simply confidence in front of the camera. Choose the right setting, take some time to get comfortable and confident, and your pictures should improve.

### Is it OK not to be photogenic?

If being ‘unphotogenic’ doesn’t bother you, don’t feel as though it’s something you have to work on. There’s nothing wrong with not being what people typically consider ‘photogenic.’ Unless it’s deeply troubling you, there is no reason to try and change this.

### Is there a psychological reason behind feeling non-photogenic?

Most of the time, the feeling that you are not photogenic is entirely psychological. There are, of course, physical elements, but these too often relate to psychological reasons. If you feel awkward and uncomfortable in front of a camera, that is how you will appear in the photo.
