## How to Flirt With a Girl and Impress Her To Get a Date

So, how exactly do you go about flirting with a girl to impress her and (hopefully) secure a date? There are a few different tactics that you can use when it comes to flirting with girls. Let’s look at some great flirting tips you may want to consider.

### Eye Contact

Drawing from our experience, one key aspect of flirting is to make eye contact. Looking everywhere else but not in her eyes may give off the impression that you are not interested in her. Maintaining eye contact makes the conversation more personal and intense – and is sure to make her blush.

### Body Language

Your body language is another critical factor when flirting with a girl. Turning your face and body towards her and moving closer will indicate that you're interested in her and her alone.

Casual touch - such as placing a hand on her arm - will make it clear to her that you are interested. For example, try sitting closer to her to let her know you don’t mind sharing each other’s space. However, read her body language and remember that some people like maintaining their personal bubble.

### Use Your Sense of Humor

Based on our first-hand experience, almost all girls appreciate a good sense of humor. So make sure you utilize yours.

Cracking a few jokes will not only ease any awkward tension but is sure to make her more interested. Be funny and be sincere, but also make sure you are yourself.

### Confidence is Key

One of the most essential things to remember when flirting with a girl is confidence. Always be confident.

Even if you do not feel particularly confident deep down. Acting confident will make you seem much more appealing and sure of yourself.

### Playful Teasing

While being kind is extremely important, that doesn’t mean you cannot playfully tease a girl you are flirting with. Playful teasing is a well-known sign of flirting, so don’t be afraid to make a cheeky jab or two.

### Active Listening Skills

How do you make a girl feel valued? Listen to her! Actively take in everything she tells you and ask insightful follow-up questions.

Ask about her friends, her hobbies, and her life. Asking questions will show her that you aren’t just flirting with her for her looks. Show her you care about her personality and what she has to say.

### Ask About Her Interests

If you are flirting with a girl, ensure you actively involve her in the conversation when you talk to her. Don’t just speak about yourself. Ask her about her interests and [make further conversation](https://thematchartist.com/blog/what-is-21-questions-to-ask-a-girl) based on her responses.

What are her favorite foods? Movies? Video games?

Asking these questions will show that you are interested in who she is.

### Genuine Compliments

If you are interested in a girl, you should compliment her! Compliments will show that you are interested and make her feel good about herself.

That being said, you should ensure you are offering genuine compliments. Girls will often be able to tell if you are authentic or not. Compliment her on aspects that you genuinely find charming.

### Finding Common Interests

Based on our observations, if you want a conversation with a girl to flow, find some common interests! Not only will this keep the conversation going, but it will demonstrate how compatible the two of you are. Discovering common interests can often lead to getting dates or ending up in long-term relationships.

### Send Her Memes

Based on our past experiences, if you are [flirting with a girl online](https://thematchartist.com/blog/how-to-flirt-with-girls-online), sending her memes is a surprisingly effective method of flirting. Of course, sending her memes will make her laugh. However, sending her a picture you think she will like shows that you regularly think about her.

### Be Subtle

If you want to flirt with a girl without outright telling her you want to date her, then you will want to be subtle. Catch her gaze and smile at her from across the room. Give her special attention, fix a stray strand of hair for her – the small details will draw her in.

### Say Good Morning and Good Night

Good morning and good night messages can go a long way when [flirting with a girl over text](https://thematchartist.com/blog/how-to-flirt-with-girls-over-text). A few words in the morning will show her that she is the first thing you think about. A few words at night will show her she is the last thing you think about before you sleep.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid While Flirting with Girls

If you form a connection with a girl and want to ask her out, flirting can be a great way to prepare for this. You can use flirting to determine whether or not she is interested. However, if you make mistakes while flirting, this can be where everything goes wrong.

Let’s look at some common flirting mistakes you want to avoid at all costs.

### Overstepping Boundaries

If you are flirting with a woman, you want to keep a close eye on her reaction. She may have some boundaries you do not want to overstep, such as physical contact. Make sure that she is comfortable and you are not crossing any lines.

### Misreading Signals

Sometimes, when flirting with someone, miscommunication can cause you to misread signals. When conversing with a woman, watch for signs that she may not be interested. If she makes excuses to leave the situation or seems uninterested, it’s time to move on.

### Being Overly Aggressive

People all over the world believe the stereotype that girls love a ‘bad boy.’ While this can be true sometimes, this does not mean girls like aggression.

There is a difference between being a ‘bad boy’ and being aggressive. Do not make her feel intimidated or fearful in any way. Being overly loud, defensive, or taking teasing from playful to rude will almost always be a dealbreaker.

### Relying on Clichés

Pulling out all of the most common pickup lines when flirting with a girl will likely not do you any favors. Girls prefer genuine compliments and meaningful conversation over clichés, so be honest and be yourself.

### Neglecting Active Listening

Asking a girl questions about herself when flirting with her is essential, but listening to her responses is equally important. If you don’t actively listen to what she is saying, she will likely be able to tell and be offended. Neglecting active listening also brings the conversation to a grinding halt.

### Misusing Humor

As mentioned earlier, using humor is excellent, but you never want to take it too far. If you are teasing a girl, keep it lighthearted and clearly in good fun.

Hold off on cracking a joke if she is opening up about something serious. Keep the humor friendly and save it for the right moments.

### Avoid One-Word Replies

This is a prevalent mistake made by men flirting with women over text. Do your absolute best to avoid one-word replies. When you receive a long message from a girl, try to send a reply of a decent length.

Putting effort and energy into your replies will keep the conversation going and reassure her you’re genuinely interested. It’s better to opt for a message like "Alright, that sounds great!” rather than just “K.”
