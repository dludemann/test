## What is a Tinder Match?

Getting a match on Tinder is when you have expressed interest in someone on the app, and they have responded in kind. That is, both people swipe right on each other’s profiles to indicate they’re interested!

Once both parties have swiped right, a match is made, and you can send one another messages. It is important to note that swiping right, or ‘liking’ someone's profile, [does not immediately guarantee a match](https://thematchartist.com/tinder/tinder-likes-but-no-matches).

## Is It Normal to Not Get Matches on Tinder?

Getting no matches on Tinder is not embarrassing or shameful – in fact, it’s extremely common. Many people who use Tinder find themselves receiving no matches. No matches can make people feel humiliated, depressed, and alone.

In reality, this is a problem that many people struggle with. Many people are left feeling desperate, lonely, and perhaps even friendless. But the good news is, it often has nothing to do with personality or appearance!

The issue of finding no matches on dating apps is a widespread problem. Whether you are using Tinder, Hinge, or Bumble, chances are you’ve encountered this issue.

People may find themselves getting no matches on Tinder for many reasons. From [app glitches](https://thematchartist.com/tinder/tinder-no-matches-bug) to [phone-specific problems](https://thematchartist.com/tinder/tinder-android-no-matches), several issues can contribute to a lack of matches.

Based on our observations, both guys and girls often struggle with being single and finding a partner on dating apps. Getting no results when using dating apps can make you feel scared that you will remain dateless forever. Don’t worry – this definitely isn’t the case.

Everyone has experienced times when they could not connect with a man or woman on a dating app. If this is happening to you, it’s understandable that you may feel anxious - maybe even hopeless. However, it’s essential to know that this is a common issue and not a reflection of you as a person.

## Why Am I Not Getting Matches on Tinder

There are many reasons why you might not be getting matches on Tinder. But it’s time to quit feeling sad and pathetic! Getting no matches doesn’t necessarily mean that you are being rejected!

### Poor Profile Photos

Drawing from our experience, one reason why you may not be getting any matches on Tinder is poor profile photos. People on dating apps can often have high standards. It’s important to put your best foot forward - first impressions matter!

Avoid including blurry, unflattering, or irrelevant photos on your Tinder profile. The most effective photos are high-quality, flattering photos - those that showcase the best version of you. Luckily, websites like [Photofeeler](https://www.photofeeler.com/) provide scores and feedback to help you determine your best photos.

### Incomplete or Generic Bio

Aside from your photos, the first impression that Tinder users will get of you is through your bio. Make sure that your bio is complete and exciting.

Try providing some unique information and noteworthy things about yourself. Incomplete or generic bios are never a good idea and are much more likely to be overlooked.

### Overly Restrictive Settings

Tinder has settings and preferences you must fill out for the app's algorithm to work correctly. For instance, preferences such as age and gender must be selected.

Make sure that you are not setting them to be overly restrictive. Restrictive settings and preferences will significantly limit the number of matches you receive.

### Infrequent App Usage

Based on our first-hand experience, you must use Tinder regularly to increase your number of matches. A match can only occur if both parties have swiped right on each other. If you’re not regularly using the app and swiping right, you’ll unlikely get a match!

### Profile Shadowban

You may not get any matches on Tinder because your account is shadowbanned. Shadowbanning can happen for various reasons, but primarily due to breaking Tinder’s terms of service. If you are concerned you have been shadowbanned, try contacting Tinder support.

### High Competition

Tinder has millions of users; I mean, there are lots of horny people in this world!

It’s a competitive platform to try to showcase yourself on. So, you may notice a lack of Tinder matches due to high levels of competition.

With over 75 million people on Tinder, it is no wonder why some people get lost in the crowd. Of course, that means there’s all the more reason to choose the right photos and refine your bio! Patience and perseverance are key when it comes to using dating apps.

### Unverified Profile

When you first set up your Tinder profile, you will be walked through a set of tasks to verify your profile. If you do not complete these steps, your account may not be visible to other users.

If your profile is not visible to other users, there’s no way you can get matches! Make sure you haven’t missed anything during the setup process.

## Actionable Tips to Get More Matches on Tinder

So, how exactly do you go about getting more matches on Tinder? There are a few key steps that you can take to improve your Tinder success!

Of course, tips that work for some may not work for others. But our advice is designed to boost your Tinder profile and help you receive matches!

### Get Your Pictures on Point

Our research indicates that one of the most effective ways to increase Tinder matches is by selecting your best photos! Both women and men often are looking for photos that show personality. It’s important to choose the best ones to upload.

Include some clear photos of your face, along with some candids of yourself. Try to include a photo of you in your element where you look most natural. A photo with your dog or group photos with friends will bring out that smile!

### Bio Like a Boss

After your photos, the next thing that users will see on your Tinder profile is your bio. You want a fun, snappy bio showing off your personality - get a bit creative with it! A well-crafted Tinder bio will greatly increase your chances of finding a match.

### Check Your Location

Tinder is a location-based dating app. If you are receiving no matches, there may be an issue with your location. Check your location settings and ensure that your location is accurate and your location preferences are set correctly.

### Upgrade to a Premium Account

If you still need help getting matched on Tinder, a possible solution is upgrading to a premium account. If you are prepared to invest some money in the app, a premium account may be the way to go. A premium account can boost your profile and help you get more matches.

### Opt for Professional Dating Photography Services

Do you scroll through prospective photos for your dating profile and find yourself not liking any? It may be time to try out a professional dating photography service.

People all over the world are opting to get professional photos taken for their dating profiles. Professional photos provide clearer, flattering images that are more likely to attract people to your profile.

### Does the Frequency of My Swiping Affect My Match Rate?

### How Long Does it Take to Get a Match on Tinder?

It can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few days for you to get your first match. The time taken to get a match depends on a range of factors. The size of the user base in your location, the number of interested parties, and the time of day all influence match rates.

### How Important are Profile Photos in Getting Matches?

The profile photos you use on your Tinder account are crucial for getting matches. Photos are the first impression that other users will have of you. Photos are the biggest influence on whether someone swipes right.
