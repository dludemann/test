# Coffee Meets Bagel Profile Examples to Boost Your Profile

Coffee Meets Bagel seems like an excellent choice for a prospective long-term partner… until you get no matches! Don’t stress; your profile might just need a little touch-up, and we can help!

In this article we’ll cover:

* What Coffee Meets Bagel is and what the platform offers
* What your profile should look like
* Some essential tips and tricks to boost your profile
* Frequently asked questions.

Let’s get into it!

## What is Coffee Meets Bagel?

[Coffee Meets Bagel](https://coffeemeetsbagel.com/) is a dating app that has received considerable acclaim. Founded by three sisters, the app aims to bring a new lens to the dating app market and enhance how singles interact.

You are the “coffee,” and your potential matches the “bagels.” Hopefully, you’ll find a partner who makes you equal to this iconic food pairing!

### Who is Coffee Meets Bagel for?

The team at Coffee Meets Bagel designed their platform for relationship experts. It’s for serious daters looking for long-term relationships rather than quick hook-ups or stagnant talking stages.

If you’re looking to go on a variety of quick dates, this is probably not the app for you. If you are ready to find ‘the one,’ Coffee Meets Bagel may well be the [perfect tool](https://thematchartist.com/coffee-meets-bagel/how-does-coffee-meets-bagel-work) to help you do so!

## How Should the Coffee Meets Bagel Profile Be Like?

So, what should you do to maximize your chance of finding a match? Should you express your desires in a relationship or emphasize your personality more?

There is no one answer to this. However, we have some guidelines below to help you get started. We’ll also explore examples of engaging and appealing profiles further on.

Let’s go!

## How to Set Up Your CMB Profile To Get Matches

### Profile Photos

A full-face photo is always a good idea, no matter which of the various dating sites or dating apps you use. Coffee Meets Bagel [requires](https://coffeemeetsbagel.medium.com/these-10-dating-photo-dos-and-donts-are-game-changers-ba15ed2bd01b) that you display at least one full-face photo to verify your profile.

You should also make sure your photos are well-lit—with natural light, if possible. Properly lit photos look better and practically pop off your profile page!

Using your profile photos to showcase personal interests and hobbies or highlight key aspects of your lifestyle is also a great idea. Photos that illustrate an individual’s personality and character can be a great way to make your profile unique. These profile photos will shine amongst a sea of portraits and selfies.

### Bio Section

Your bio section should give people some at-a-glance information about you. It should tell people what you’re into, the sports team you support, and what you do for work, among other interests. Keep it simple and honest, with maybe a few quick quips to add spice.

### Personal Details

Location, occupation, age, and other personal details are essential facts when considering a relationship. Filling in this information as accurately as possible is an excellent way to ensure you find an authentic match.

### Prompts and Responses

Coffee Meets Bagel’s prompts can be a great way to kickstart a profile and help ensure that prospective matches know more about you. The prompts allow you to compose a narrative that captures attention and are a great way to get started.

Your responses to the prompts can help you detail specific preferences and tastes and showcase unique qualities or attributes. Prompts are especially handy if you’re feeling a bit of writer’s block!

### Interests and Hobbies

Make sure not just to share your interests and hobbies as one-word ideas but describe and depict them through how you experience them.

Doing so can help share insights into personal values and beliefs that other users will want to know. Describing your interests well can also emphasize important traits or qualities you value. In particular, these details can help you align with a potential match who is enthusiastic about key parts of your life.

### Education and Career Information

You don’t have to go too deep into this if it isn’t essential, or you can spend a lot of time on it. Regardless, you should probably list something here. A quick one-liner like “I am a \[insert role here\] and/or studied at \[educational institution\].” can cover this point nicely.

Educational and career information can be awkward for those unemployed or without higher education. If that’s you, you can always try putting a humorous spin on it.

For example, “Weirdly, a fine arts degree doesn’t pay my bills, despite all my friends telling me it would.” is a humorous way to downplay this section. Additionally, if you enjoy a cutting, dry sense of humor, you could try something to showcase this.

For example, “College sounded like a scam, maybe because I got my admissions offer from someone claiming to need vast sums of money to guarantee a future income gain. Oh, wait!”.

### Lifestyle Preferences

If there’s anywhere you might need to turn the silly dial down, this is it. Your lifestyle preferences should convey a sense of authenticity and sincerity. Lifestyle preferences are among the most important sections for a seriously interested potential partner.

Your answers to the lifestyle preferences section will demonstrate compatibility with potential matches. If you don’t match someone else’s desire to have kids, live in a particular place, and so on, you’ll probably not make it long-term.

So, be sure to be up-front, honest, and transparent about what you are looking for in your new relationship.

## How to Create a High Quality CMB Profile

### Choosing the Right Photos

Some key criteria exist for choosing the right photos for any dating app, whether Tinder, Bumble, or Coffee Meets Bagel. They are:

* Good lighting
* High-quality camera
* Getting someone else to take the photo - try to avoid selfies
* Smile
* Diversity

The first three are all about photo quality. Get someone else to take the photo in good lighting with a nice(ish) camera. This type of photo is much better than a selfie in your room with the curtains closed and a bright white bulb in.

The following two are about putting you in your best frame. You’d be surprised how far a smile can enhance your authenticity and honesty. If you get a genuine photo of you enjoying yourself, people are more likely to be interested in your biography and other sections.

Based on our observations, photo diversity can help enticingly explain interests and hobbies. Seeing you on a run or at a concert holds more weight.

People don’t just want to read a few sentences like “I love to exercise and listen to music.” They want to see it! Overall, photo selection and quality are two of the most important ways to enhance your profile.

### Writing an Engaging Bio

Writing an engaging dating app bio is tricky. You have to strike a balance between humor and seriousness.

After all, nobody wants to be with someone who can’t crack a joke or two. But the same is true of someone who makes everything a big deal.

Luckily, it’s easier than you think for a profile bio to portray a well-rounded image of the individual behind it. Make sure that you:

* Keep it relatively no-nonsense; crack your best jokes in your prompts section!
* Articulate what sets the profile apart from others
* Write in a way that creates a sense of intrigue or curiosity

### Answering Profile Prompts and Questions

Profile prompts and questions help you tell your story. [Think of them as icebreakers](https://coffeemeetsbagel.medium.com/how-to-fill-out-your-dating-profile-like-a-pro-254bd84d976d). They help people understand your interests and get a sense of who you are.

Profile prompts help prevent having the classic awkward first conversation of “So, what are you interested in?” When answering these prompts, don’t just give one-word answers!

Your hobby isn’t just “soccer,” is it? What do you like about it? What’s your favorite part?

Filling out the prompts like this can help other users understand you better from the get-go. As a result, you’ll already have something helpful to discuss when they message you!

## How to Make Your Coffee Meets Bagel Profile Stand Out

### Leveraging Premium Features

Coffee Meets Bagel offers a premium tier, which allows access to more features! These include boosts to ensure you get as many matches as possible. Other features also help you refine your searches and reach more interested people.

It can be difficult to understand all the premium features you can access, which range from ‘[boosts](https://thematchartist.com/coffee-meets-bagel/coffee-meets-bagel-boost)’ to ‘[beans](https://thematchartist.com/coffee-meets-bagel/coffee-meets-bagel-beans).’ It’s a good idea to take some time to understand your options.

### Taking Advantage of Additional Profiles

While you can technically create multiple profiles to help you get more matches, this is frowned upon. Being caught could result in being barred from the service or, at the very least, being reduced to just one profile.

### Crafting Depth Profiles

Based on our first-hand experience, it's super important to ensure you aren’t just running surface-level sentences in your profile. Instead, try to include some key match compatibility indicators.

Describe what you’re looking for in a relationship, your interests, lifestyle, and so on. Make sure you expand on these points throughout your profile. Depth in your profile makes you much more exciting and typically leads to a much more rewarding first interaction with a match!

### Posting High-quality Dating Profile Pictures

A picture tells a thousand words, and this saying has never been more true than in dating profiles. Pictures can say a lot about women and guys, and yours are no different!

To get more attention on your profile at first glance, make sure that your dating profile pictures are as high-quality as possible. That means good lighting, camera quality, and an outfit you like.

Pictures that feature favorite activities or passions can also help tell your thousand words. Now, you can use your profile section for more in-depth comments on your hobbies or other topics!

## Example Coffee Meets Bagel Profiles

### Coffee Meets Bagel Female Profile Examples

Age: 23

Location: New York City

I am… a primary school teacher! I love kids and have wanted to work with them since my final year of high school. I’m in my first year of teaching, and it’s going awesome so far, although I could be more enthusiastic about the boogers my little ones like to show me.

I like… lots of things! When I’m not at work, I’m a huge fitness girlie, and you’ll often find me in the woods or up a hill somewhere. I made it to Yellowstone last year, and it was one of the best experiences of my life. I’d love to make similar trips in the future.

I appreciate it when my date… shows up on time and has a great sense of humor. My time is quite limited with my busy work schedule and volunteering at my local animal shelter, so no messing around is a must. Tolerance for a walk is also excellent—I love joint exercise dates!

### Coffee Meets Bagel Guy Profile Examples

Age: 21

Location: San Francisco

I am… a builder by trade, but my real passion is for photography. My coworkers often spot me on the job site snapping away and giving me a hard time. The joke will be on them when I make it big someday!

I like… movies, music, and many things other than photography. In particular, I enjoy chilling out in a grassy area with my headphones on to destress after a long day at work. Fall Out Boy and P! ATD are great soundtracks for any afternoon.

I appreciate it when my date… brings various skills to the table. I think being interested in and capable of multiple activities is a hugely important quality in any person, and I would love to find a partner who cultivates interests across a wide range of areas like myself.

## 7 Tips To Create a Match-Worthy Coffee Meets Bagel Profile

### Determine What You Want in a Match

Make a list of your ideal qualities for a partner.

Do you want them to enrich your life through intellectual conversation? Does a good sense of humor make the top of your list? Are you looking for somebody interested in your hobbies?

Don’t forget about your crucial relationship goals.

If you’re on Coffee Meets Bagel, you’re looking for a long-term relationship, but what kind? Do you want to have kids one day? What about living styles?

Before you create your profile, try to craft a picture of who you want to end up with. That way, you can write your profile in a way that makes it clear who you are interested in.

### Post High-quality Professional Dating Photographs

Many profiles fail to capture the essence of a person’s individuality. Generic selfie number five isn’t exactly a game-changer.

Instead, ensure you get high-quality pictures that paint the best possible picture of you. These authentic pictures will bolster your profile with diverse, exciting content.

### Utilize App Currency and Premium Preferences

Premium preference filters can help screen potential partners based on your relationship goals, personal interests, and other essential criteria. By experimenting with different filters, you may discover the perfect combination that accurately reflects your desired relationship. These filters can also assist you in crafting a better overall profile, as they help you understand your preferences better.

### Use a Diverse Set of Profile Photos

Four selfies in a row aren’t exactly going to raise eyebrows, even if you’re the most stunning man or woman in the known world. People aren’t on Coffee Meets Bagel for a quick, appearance-focused relationship. They’re looking for the big L, love!

Instead, include action photos—walking a trail or playing music. You could even include a picture of yourself at work if that’s a big part of your life. Use your profile photos to tell your story just as much, if not more, than you do your bio.

### Receive High-Quality Matches Every Day at Noon

On Coffee Meets Bagel, you’ll be sent potential matches daily [at noon](https://coffeemeetsbagel.medium.com/the-science-behind-setting-your-preferences-liking-bagels-b0b84551e421)—don’t skip them! Look through them as soon as possible to show you’re still active on the app. This proactivity will also give you time to think over the potential matches and to match at an appropriate hour.

The app's users will likely be aware that this is when new match suggestions come through. They’ll be ready and waiting to initiate conversations.

### Develop Meaningful Connections with Potential Matches

Don’t just send one message and leave—ensure you continue engaging with a match. Try texting about your cultural and personal identity, life, interests, and so on.

Talking about topics that matter to you is an excellent opportunity to build a closer relationship. This approach will also help you determine if you’ve found the one.

### Think of Prompts As a Way to Break the Ice

You probably hope the other person will use the prompts in your profile. So, make sure you use the ones in theirs to break the ice if you’re sending the first message!

## Key Takeaways

While it can be tricky to keep up with online dating, hopefully, this article has given you some good ideas! Some final tips:

* Make sure your factual information (name, location, age, etc.) is accurate and to the point. Also, make sure your privacy settings hide none of it!
* Choose good photos, answer prompts with lots of detail, and write a long bio rather than a short one.
* Use success stories and testimonials, profile customization options, and feedback from friends to help maximize your profile’s success.

Good luck out there!
