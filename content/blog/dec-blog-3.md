## What is a Bumble Profile Picture?

Your [Bumble profile picture](https://bumble.com/en/the-buzz/best-bumble-profile-photo-tips) is the picture you choose to represent you on the Bumble app. You’re allowed six photos on Bumble, and the [first one you upload](https://bumble.com/en/help/how-can-i-change-my-profile-photo#:~:text=If%20you're%20using%20Bumble,the%20order%20you%20would%20like.) will be your main profile picture, so it needs to stand out.

This is the first image users will see during their swiping experience and first impressions matter! The picture serves as an introduction to your appearance, personality, and lifestyle, offering a little glimpse into who you are. Due to this, it’s important to consider the quality, angle, background, and lighting of your profile picture to attract attention from potential matches.

## Why Profile Picture on Bumble Matters

We know looks aren’t everything, but a [good profile picture](https://thematchartist.com/blog/dating-app-pictures) on Bumble really matters. When a photo is uploaded to the profile, it is a key aspect of the user’s profile and plays an important role in attracting dates.

A good picture not only tells a story about who you are, but it can spark conversations, create connections, and lead to friendships and even long-term relationships. It’s an essential part of your dating experience and has a big impact on how people on the app perceive you.

## Types of Photos to Use

Selecting the [right types of photos](https://bumble.com/en/the-buzz/best-bumble-profile-photo-tips) for your profile is essential. A good photo attracts potential matches and captures the user’s personality. With a great picture, your profile stands out among others and even conveys a sense of confidence. There are a few different types of photos you can use on your profile - just make sure you choose pictures that reflect your authentic self and complement the information in your bio.

### Athletic Photos

An athletic photo shows the user’s favorite activities and is a conversation starter for other fitness junkies. It also shows you have a fit and healthy lifestyle, which is attractive for those who also value wellness.

### Full-body Shot

A full body shot shows what you look like, which is important in the days when everyone’s terrified of being catfished! It’s also a great way to show off your sense of style with a well-chosen outfit. Face pictures are important too, just combine them with some full-length pics for balance.

### Social Shots

We highly recommend that you don’t use group photos for your profile picture - this can cause confusion! That being said, social shots are a great way to show you taking part in social activities, which shows you value friendship and having fun.

### Action Shots

This is a great one for extreme sports enthusiasts! An action shot demonstrates the user’s style and interests and often is taken in natural lighting which is flattering. They’re great for natural conversation starters and sharing things like your hobbies and interests.

### A Candid Photo

A candid photo that reveals a genuine smile and captures the user’s personality is perfect. Candid pictures are unposed and often feature spontaneous moments, which are liked by other users due to their authenticity.

### A Travel Photo

If travel is important to you, make sure your profile picture reflects that! It’s a great way to show your favorite activities and travel locations, as well as attract like-minded matches. It’s perfect for showing off your adventurous side!

### A Pet Photo

If your fur baby is important to you, include them in one of your profile pictures! You want to ensure any matches are also animal lovers, and it’s a great way to represent yourself and showcase your love for animals.

## Types of Photos to Avoid

So we’ve gone over types of photos to use, but what about what to avoid? Offputting or poorly thought-out pictures can send the wrong message and reduce your chances of making connections. Here’s what to avoid so you can maintain a good online presence!

### Shirtless Photos

Shirtless photos, particularly [shirtless mirror selfies](https://bumble.com/en/the-buzz/best-bumble-profile-photo-tips), are in general not a good idea. They make you come across as arrogant and vain, and can also make you appear like you’re just interested in hookups. They focus too much on your appearance and can overshadow other aspects of your personality and lifestyle.

### Scary Photos

Scary or otherwise offputting photos are definitely a no-no! One mistake often made by guys is to include photos of themselves hunting- often including freshly killed game. While you might be proud of your kill, it’s best to wait to get to know someone before showing off your hunting pics, as some might find them upsetting. It’s also best to avoid extreme angles and dark lighting, as these can make you appear unapproachable and scary - you want to go for a confident and friendly appearance.

### Average-looking Photos

Average-looking photos that are blurry or low effort may reduce your match options. Focus on photos that highlight your eyes and best features, and make sure you smile. You want your photos to reflect the best possible you - after all, you only have one chance to make your first impression!

## Best Practices for a Good Bumble Profile Picture

A good online dating app profile begins with a great profile picture. This is crucial for creating a good first impression and ensuring your profile stands out.

### Use Bumble's Photo Feature

Bumble’s [Best Photo](https://bumble.com/en-us/the-buzz/how-to-use-bumble-best-photo-feature) feature decides for you which image should be at the front of your Bumble profile. How it works is simple - it uses technology to figure out which of your first three profile pictures is most attractive to other daters, and then it puts that picture first.

### Choose a Clear, High-Quality Image

There’s no excuse for blurry, low-resolution photos now that every phone can take high quality images! Make sure you upload only clear, high-resolution images, as bad pictures detract from your overall appearance.

### Prioritize Solo Shots Over Group Photos

While group shots are ok for your fifth or sixth photos, keep them out of your first three. They can cause confusion over which one in the group is actually you! While it's great to show you have an active social life, you should definitely prioritize solo shots.

### Feature a Genuine Smile and Eye Contact

A genuine smile and eye contact in your profile makes you come across as more attractive and engaging. Look straight at the camera and smile - you’ll seem more approachable and users will be more likely to swipe right.

### Select Photos That Reflect Your Personality

Authenticity is incredibly important in online dating, so make sure your photos reflect your personality and interests. Avoid generic, basic pictures and get some shots of you engaging in your hobbies or getting outdoors and into nature.

### Ensure Good Lighting in Your Pictures

Good lighting is crucial - in our experience, natural lighting is often the best choice. Take some photos outdoors or in well-lit areas and your images will instantly look better.

### Avoid Common Photo Mistakes

Avoid mirror selfies, sunglasses in every picture, heavy filters, and using old pictures. These can be misleading and can even hide your natural appearance. And we hate to say it, but guys, avoid those fish pictures! Most women are not that interested in the size of your latest catch.

### Regularly Update Your Profile Picture

Keep your profile picture current! If you’ve recently reactivated Bumble after a couple of years break, don’t just reuse your old pictures. You want your photos to accurately give a picture of what you look like now - not what you looked like at age 25! If you’re getting [no matches](https://thematchartist.com/bumble/no-matches) on Bumble, have an honest look at your profile pictures - they may be in need of an upgrade.

### Hire Professional Dating Photography Services

If you’ve tried and your pictures still don’t leave the best impression, look into [hiring a professional](https://thematchartist.com/blog/should-i-get-professional-photos-for-online-dating) service like The Match Artist. They specialize in creating profile pictures for dating platforms that represent the true you and highlight your best features. The Match Artist understands how online dating works and uses their unique facial expression coaching to capture anyone in the best light.

## How Many Pictures on Bumble Can You Post?

Bumble lets you list [six profile pictures](https://bumble.com/en/the-buzz/best-bumble-profile-photo-tips), and we highly recommend you use all six! Bumble’s data shows that profiles that use three or more of the profile picture slots get more matches - what do you have to lose?

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Should I Include Group Photos in My Bumble Profile?

It’s fine to include group photos, just don’t make them your main profile picture! We suggest keeping group photos for your fifth and sixth pictures to keep the focus on you.

### Can Selfies Be Effective as Bumble Profile Pictures?

A well-taken, attractive selfie is fine, just make sure all your pictures aren’t selfies! Include full body shots and photos taken in different positions and settings to give a true reflection of what you look like.

### How Should I Unblur Bumble Profile Pictures?

While you always have the ability to see your mutual matches on Bumble, blurred photos are those who have liked your profile but who you have not yet liked. These are in your [‘Beeline’](https://bumble.com/en-au/help/what-is-the-beeline) and you can unblur these profile pictures by paying for Bumble Boost or Premium.
