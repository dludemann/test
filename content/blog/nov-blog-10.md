Our article looks at:

* What CMB is
* What a disappearing chat looks like
* Possible reasons your CMB chat has disappeared
* Recovering a lost chat

* Answers to some frequently asked questions.

Let’s take a look!

## What is Coffee Meets Bagel?

[Coffee Meets Bagel](https://coffeemeetsbagel.com/) is a dating app that focuses on providing members with quality matches. It was invented by three sisters who were tired of the modern dating scene. The app’s focus is on quality matches over endless swiping, creating a less overwhelming experience where users can discover each other and form relationships.

### How Does Coffee Meets Bagel Work?

CMB [provides users](https://thematchartist.com/coffee-meets-bagel/how-does-coffee-meets-bagel-work) with curated matches or ‘bagels’ every day. These are based on a user’s profile preferences and their activity on the app. They then have 24 hours to decide whether to like the bagels or pass on them. Once you like someone, you can open up a private chat to get to know the other person. CMB’s focus on serious dating over hookups and its use of data and user feedback distinguishes it from other dating apps like Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge.

## What is the Chat Disappearing Feature of CMB?

Sometimes you’re chatting with a bagel, and your chat [disappears](https://coffeemeetsbagel.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/14568739127571-I-can-t-find-a-chat#:~:text=Occasionally%2C%20Bagels%20might%20choose%20to,the%20chat%20once%20this%20happens.)! This might appear to be a glitch or a bug in the app, or in some cases due to your match leaving the chat. Regardless of the cause, you will either see the chat disappear as you’re using it or when you go to look for the chat, it won’t be there.

## Reasons for 'Coffee Meets Bagel Chat Disappeared'

Conversations can disappear due to technical issues or due to actions from your match. Understanding these reasons can help you figure out how to get the chat back - or if it’s even possible!

### Network Connection Issues

Any app can be affected by network connection issues, and Coffee Meets Bagel is no exception. A patchy internet connection can mean your chat can be erased accidentally and vanish unexpectedly. Luckily, if this is your culprit, it’s easy to resolve. Check your network settings and ensure you have a stable connection - this should restore your chat history.

### Unresponsive Server Issues

An unresponsive server can also cause missing conversations or general slowness or lack of response in the app. In these cases, the best fix is time - be patient, and go and do something else for an hour or two. In most cases, when you return the server issues will be fixed and your chats will be working.

### You or Your Match Deleted the App

There’s not much you can do about this one, unfortunately! Sometimes the ‘bagel’ you’re chatting with might decide to delete the CMB app. This will result in your conversation disappearing. If you deleted the app and then reinstalled it, this can also affect your chat history - in these cases, it’s best to just move on and find new bagels.

### You or the Match Unmatched With Each Other

If you or the other person unmatch with the other, the conversation will be deleted automatically from both inboxes. Although you’ll obviously be aware if you’ve unmatched with someone, you won’t have a notification if someone is unmatched with you - the chat will simply disappear. All you can do is move on and start a new chat with someone new. There is no way to recover the chat history, unfortunately!

### You Have Reached Your Daily Limit of Matches

Although this isn’t an official CMB policy, [some Reddit users](https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeemeetsbagel/comments/b6f6c0/number_of_matches/) believe that CMB limits the number of chats you can have open at one time. If you’ve noticed chats disappearing and you have several matches on the go, try reducing your daily limit and going for quality over quantity.

### Using a Third-Party App to Access CMB

Although uncommon, using a third-party app could lead to technical glitches and chat disappearances. The apps might not connect with the servers correctly which can lead to lost data and missing conversations.

### The User May Have Blocked You

If a user blocks you, the chat will disappear from the inbox. Even if you don’t believe you did anything wrong, any user has the right to block you -it’s part of CMB’s policy to ensure user safety.

### The User's Account May Have Been Banned or Deleted

If the person you were chatting with has been engaging in behavior that goes against CMB [community guidelines](https://coffeemeetsbagel.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016483874-Coffee-Meets-Bagel-Community-Guidelines), they might be banned. This will mean the disappearance of all their conversations, with no way to get them back.

### Coffee Meets Bagel Chat Expired

If your chat is inactive (meaning no one is replying or messaging) it will close after seven days. You can pay in CMB’s in-app currency (beans) to [extend](https://coffeemeetsbagel.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020787834-How-do-I-extend-a-chat) the chat, however! These hats are removed as a method of clearing the chat history to free up space and encourage people to keep conversations active.

## How to Recover Your Lost Chats on Coffee Meets Bagel

While a chat disappearance can be frustrating, in some cases it’s possible to get the chats back. These strategies can help retrieve missing messages and restore the lost conversation. Follow these tips to recover your chat history and continue your conversation!

### Check If It is a Network Error and Reconnect to the Internet

Poor internet connection can mean your chats don’t load or even disappear. Make sure your connection is reliable and disconnect then reconnect to the internet if necessary.

### Refresh the App and Log Back in Again After Some Time

Try refreshing the app and updating it - in some cases, this can bring back lost chats. Follow these steps:

* Log out of your CMB account
* Close the app and wait at least one hour
* Update the app
* Reopen the app and lock it back in.

This can help retrieve missing messages by forcing the app to update its data.

### Check If You or Your Match Has Deleted Their Profile

Check if your match is still active in your area - if they’ve deleted their profile, this could be the reason for your missing messages. Scroll through the potential profiles in your area using the Discover feature - if you can’t find them, they may have left the app, and you can move on to new matches.

### Re-Match With Them Again

If you do find their profile, try re-matching with them again. If you were unmatched due to a technical glitch, you can have another chance to continue your conversation.

### Upgrade to Premium to Increase Your Number of Possible Matches Per Day

Upgrading to [CMB premium](https://coffeemeetsbagel.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/360001489753-Premium-Subscription) is another option if you want to increase your number of daily matches. It also gives you the ability to see likes and reconnect with expired matches.

### Contact Customer Support for Assistance

If you can’t figure out what’s causing your disappearing chats, or if it’s a repeated issue, see if customer support can help recover your lost chats. They can investigate the issue and assist you. If you report the problem to support, they may be able to resolve the technical glitch and address the disappearance of your conversation.

## Preventive Measures and Best Practices

To get the most out of CMB, you need to know how to prevent issues from occurring in the first place. Here are some key strategies to ensure you don’t run into problems.

### Regularly Updating the App

In our view, an update to the latest version of the app is one of the best ways to keep all software running smoothly - not just the CMB app! Updates often contain new features, bug fixes, and other enhancements that mean the app has greater stability and improved performance. Check for updates regularly - this one trick can resolve existing glitches and keep the app running without issues. You can also refresh the app interface and reset the app settings if you notice you’re having issues.

### Backing Up Important Chats

If you have conversations that are of particular value or importance to you, try backing them up. For example, if a man or woman shares their phone number and information about an upcoming date, you may wish to screenshot this so you don’t lose due to a glitch.

### Being Aware of the App’s Terms of Service

It’s crucial to stay aware of the app’s terms of service. Violating the community guidelines can get you banned or cause your match to block you - this may be the cause of your disappearing chats.
