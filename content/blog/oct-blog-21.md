## Tinder Likes vs. Matches - What’s the Difference?

You first need to know the difference between Tinder likes and matches. A Tinder ‘like’ is when someone swipes right on another person's profile, indicating interest in them.

Tinder has a similar matching process to other popular dating platforms, such as Bumble. For a Tinder ‘match’ to occur, both parties must have ‘liked’ each other by swiping right. Once two people have matched on Tinder, messaging will be enabled, and they can now start chatting.

Tinder utilizes an ‘ELO score’ to determine which profiles you see on the app. ELO is a system that evaluates players in zero-sum games such as chess.<br><br>For the context of Tinder, an ELO score is a rating that attaches to each profile. The score dictates who you see and who sees you.

The algorithm monitors your activity and shows you viable options to match with and form a connection with. This method is how many dating sites operate and can often lead to people finding their future partner or spouse!

## Why am I Getting Tinder Likes But No Matches?

It can be very frustrating if you have been using Tinder for a while and getting likes but no matches. Nothing is worse than waiting by your phone for that Tinder match notification and never receiving it.

The good news is this issue usually has an easy solution.

It’s possible you may be experiencing a [Tinder bug](https://thematchartist.com/tinder/tinder-no-matches-bug) or [phone-related issues](https://thematchartist.com/tinder/tinder-android-no-matches). If not, there are several other reasons why you are getting Tinder likes but no matches.

### Profile Picture Not Appealing

Your Tinder profile picture is the first impression other people on the app will get of you. Since many people have high standards, you must ensure it’s a showstopping photo.

The importance of an appealing profile picture is equally applicable to both men and women. However, guys often report struggling with this issue more. Still, everyone using dating apps should take care to nail the right profile pic!

If you notice that you are not getting any Tinder matches, it may be time to change the pics on your profile. There are several ways to determine the best picture for your dating profile. Try asking friends or even quizzing strangers on the internet through picture rating websites such as [Photofeeler](https://www.photofeeler.com/).

### Bad Lighting in Photos

Lighting is one of the most important factors when taking a good photo for a dating app. Dark lighting can obscure your features and make people less inclined to match with you. Lighting that casts shadows in the wrong places can also make your picture appear unflattering or unappealing.

### Unclear Age Range or Location Settings

Tinder has a few filters you will need to set before you get swiping. Setting these filters right will ensure you see people close to your age and location.

If you’re still not receiving any matches on Tinder, then be sure to check these filters. Double-check the status of your age range and location settings to ensure they are correct.

It’s also prudent to check that you have correctly listed your age and location. You could be in your early twenties but have accidentally input your age as late sixties. Mistakes such as this may explain a lack of matches on the app.

### Boring Bio

Bios are one of the critical parts of Tinder profiles that are often overlooked. If your bio isn’t exciting and doesn’t contain much information about yourself, people are unlikely to match with you. Try spicing up your bio with jokes and fun facts about yourself that show your personality.

## Strategies to Consider When Getting Few Matches Despite Receiving Plenty of Likes

Now you know what may be causing you to receive Tinder likes but no matches. But what steps can you take to fix this issue? There are a few things that you can do to [increase your chances of getting matches on Tinder](https://thematchartist.com/tinder/no-matches-on-tinder).

### Revamp Your Profile Picture

The first step to boost your Tinder matches is to revamp your profile picture. Try to include a clear, flattering face shot with good lighting.

Remember, your profile picture is the first thing that will catch the eye of a prospective match. A profile picture can often determine whether that special someone swipes left or wants to discover more. First impressions matter!

This shot can be a selfie, or - here’s an idea - hire a photographer to take professional dating profile photos! Many people all over the world have begun to utilize professional photographers to enhance their dating profiles.

### Improve Lighting Quality

Another photo-related issue to consider is the lighting quality of your images. No one wants to up their screen brightness to see your face.

Bright, natural lighting is often your best bet when lighting your photos. Darker photos with not a lot of light and plenty of shadows aren’t likely flattering.

### Consider Upgrading to a Paid Tinder Plan

If you are in the position and have the money to do so, try investing in a paid Tinder plan. Paid plans like Tinder Plus can be game changers when trying to increase the number of matches you receive. Tinder offers a range of subscription plans with different benefits, so you can choose one that best suits your needs.

### Speak With a Dating Consultant

Something that many people don’t consider in their online journey is speaking with a dating consultant. Advice from dating consultants is not only applicable to in-person dating. Dating consultants can be endlessly helpful regarding online dating - how you present yourself and interact with others on dating apps.

Many people are often hesitant to speak with a dating consultant. However, the research that these experts have undertaken can provide you with essential knowledge. This knowledge will help boost your potential for finding love on dating apps.

### Add More Photos to Your Profile

Another essential thing to consider when creating your Tinder profile is the number of photos you add. If you only have one or two photos on your profile, this can raise alarm bells when others consider swiping.

People may believe you to be a catfish who has stolen photos from someone else's social media websites. Alternatively, they may want to see a wider variety of pictures of you to understand better what you look like.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How Long Does a Tinder Shadowban Last?

Unfortunately, there is no end date to a Tinder shadow ban – these often last indefinitely. If your account has been shadowbanned, you can file a report or appeal with Tinder or create a new account.

### Does Tinder Show All Likes?

The standard version of Tinder will not show you all the people who liked you before you swiped on them. However, subscription plans, like Tinder Gold and Tinder Platinum, show every account that likes you.

### Can You See Who Disliked You On Tinder?

No, you can’t see which users have disliked you on Tinder. While it is normal to be curious about this, Tinder does not offer this feature. Tinder likely wants to keep morale and self-esteem high.
