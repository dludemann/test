## What Is Bumble?

[Bumble](https://bumble.com/) is a dating app with a difference! It stands out from other apps with its unique approach to the way singles interact — it only allows women to make the first move in heterosexual matches. This feature sets Bumble apart in the online dating landscape and has helped Bumble gain its reputation as a platform that prioritizes consent and respectful behavior.

As well as dating, Bumble is also a place for users to meet friends and increase their business connections, with the platforms Bumble BFF and Bumble Bizz. With Bizz, you have the opportunity to work on social media networking, growing your company, and expanding your business. With Bumble BFF, for example, you can look for friends who are interested in the same kinds of things you are, and make plans to meet face-to-face at a cafe or the beach.

Bumble uses a similar swiping system to other popular apps like Tinder, wherein users swipe right to make a match or left to pass. Bumble also makes use of AI technology and photo detection to ensure the content shared is authentic and appropriate. This approach by the Bumble team prioritizes user safety and ensures everyone’s internet dating experience is consensual.

## Can You Send Photos on Bumble?

Bumble allows users to send photos via its chat feature, but the process is regulated to protect users.
