## What are Tinder Smart Photos?

Tinder Smart Photos is a feature that automatically reorders [the pictures on your profile](https://thematchartist.com/tinder/photos/) so that your best photos are displayed first. The team at Tinder implemented this feature to increase match and success rates.

Having your most flattering picture displayed first on your dating profile makes you more likely to catch the attention of potential partners.

This style of feature is also becoming increasingly popular on other dating apps, such as Bumble, which has its ‘Best Photo’ feature.

What’s more, Tinder Smart Photos is now a global feature available to all Tinder accounts, no matter their location. However, there have been some mixed opinions since its introduction. Some users swear by it, while others avoid it.

## How Does Tinder Smart Photos Work?

Tinder uses the feedback of other profiles on the app to determine which of your photos work best. Your pictures are rearranged based on data regarding how others respond to your profile.

For example, let’s say other users tend to swipe right on a particular picture of you. In that case, Tinder’s algorithm will shuffle your photos so that this image is always displayed first.

### Smart Photos Aims to Optimize Your Profile

The reason behind the Tinder Smart Photos feature is quite simple. The goal is to enhance your profile and increase your chances of finding a match!

The data points collected by Tinder undergo extensive testing to ensure an optimal photo order for everyone.

However, not all users feel that the Tinder Smart Photos feature truly optimizes their profile. The rearranging process is based on AI data collection and many users on the app prioritize real human feedback.

## Should I Use Tinder Smart Photos?

Whether or not you decide to use the Tinder Smart Photos feature depends entirely on your preferences.

You may prefer to have complete control over your profile and the final say on which of your photos is shown first.

Another reason to avoid Tinder Smart Photos is if you have a particular photo that best encapsulates who you are as a person. You might wish for this photo to remain first.

You may also want to avoid the Tinder Smart Photos feature due to the limitations of the data collection process.

It's possible that enabling this feature may actually decrease your match rate instead of increasing it, and we will explain why.

## Limitations of Tinder Smart Photos

While Tinder Smart Photos is useful, the system has some flaws. For one, some of the data gathered may be inaccurate.

The system determines your ‘best’ photo based on how many people swipe right on it. However, this photo may not be an accurate representation of your best self!

Occasionally, someone may scroll through your profile photos and swipe right on one of the photos further down your gallery. This behavior could cause issues for the Smart Photos analysis technology.

Still, most users will swipe right on your first profile photo. As such, Tinder Smart Photos is more likely to work accurately than not.

## Practical Advice for Using Tinder Smart Photos Ef fectively

Tinder Smart Photos may not be everyone's cup of tea. But there are ways to use this feature effectively to increase the number of likes and matches you receive.

The Smart Photos feature allows you to review and arrange the order of pictures. You can also arrange your images in a suggested order for a week or so and gauge how effective it is for you.

Remember, you can always change them back if you are unhappy with the results.

### Strategies for Selecting Photos for Better Results

So, you’re aware of the potential for inaccurate data collection with Tinder Smart Photos. As such, you’d prefer to get feedback on your pics from real people. This is where websites such as [Photofeeler](https://www.photofeeler.com/) come in handy.

On Photofeeler, real-life people—women and men—will give you an honest rating on your photos. This is a great way to get a genuine opinion of which photos of you are the best.

Importantly, the opinions are from guys and girls who aren’t in your immediate circle of friends. Because, let's be honest, the opinions of friends can often be biased.

Another way to select better photos for your Tinder profile is to view them critically as if you are seeing them for the first time.

Ask yourself: if I saw a picture similar to this on a dating app, would I match with this person? Try to select a picture with an interesting background where you are facing the front and making eye contact with the camera.

If you find none of your selfies are up to scratch, consider [hiring a professional photographer for your online dating photos](https://thematchartist.com/blog/should-i-get-professional-photos-for-online-dating). This is an idea that a lot of dating app users are gravitating toward.

A professional photographer can produce high-quality, flattering pictures of you for your dating profile.

### When to Use and When to Avoid Tinder Smart Photos

If you are already confident in your photo selection order, then Tinder Smart Photos may hinder you more than help. The app may try to shuffle your photos in an order that you disagree with.

The good news is that the app will send you a notification before it reorders your pictures. You can then decide whether or not you want to make the change.

As a general rule, try to have your Tinder profile reflect the type of person you are. Your top photo, according to Smart Photos, may get you the most matches. However, it may not be the first impression you want to give off.

## Key Takeaways

Whether or not you use the Tinder Smart Photos feature is entirely up to you and the kind of impression you want to leave on other users.

Some users may wish to use this feature to get as many matches as possible, while others may prefer complete control over their photo order.

You have the option to test suggested orders and can always decide when you receive a notification before reordering.

Go with what feels right for you and what you’ve had good feedback on before!
