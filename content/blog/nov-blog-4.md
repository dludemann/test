## How Does CMB Boost Work?

The Boost function is a great tool for anyone who is serious about online dating. It is a great way to enhance the user’s profile visibility and increase interactions - here’s how the feature works:

### Overview of the Process

When you activate your boost, it prioritizes and showcases the profile to a targeted group, ensuring it appears in other users' feeds so it receives attention from a wider range of singles. This increases the chances of getting matches as people are seeing your profile!

### Matching Algorithm

The algorithm considers your location, preferences, previous activities, and likes on the site. When someone activates their Boost, it amplifies the user’s profile, so it appears to have more potential matches - improving the likelihood of being noticed!

### Premium Subscription Options

When you have a [Premium](https://thematchartist.com/coffee-meets-bagel/coffee-meets-bagel-premium)membership, you get a free monthly profile boost, which brings with it up to 5x more profile views! This is the ideal way to maximize your exposure and attract matches.

### Profile View Reports

Coffee Meets Bagel [doesn’t](https://versus.com/en/coffee-meets-bagel)show you who has viewed or visited your profile, but the data shows Boost does increase the eyes on your profile by around [5x and your matches by up to 3x](https://www.forbes.com/health/dating/coffee-meets-bagel-review/).

### Activity Reports

Premium subscriptions can receive an activity report on other users to see when they’re active. It’s a great way to [gauge how likely a user is to engage with you](https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeemeetsbagel/comments/ujaz6p/activity_report/) based on their activity history.

### Special Features

In our experience, one of the best features of a CMB profile boost is the ability to boost at peak times, to maximize your chances of being seen. Using it strategically attracts more likes and interactions thanks to the higher user numbers at peak times.

## Advantages of Coffee Meets Bagel Boost

With so many online dating apps offering a variety of premium features, making a decision can sometimes feel pretty much impossible. The Boost feature from Coffee Meets Bagel stands out among other apps’ features thanks to its focus on quality profiles and long-term relationships.

### Quality Profiles

Using Boost on CMB increases the visibility of a user's profile, which attracts more likes and interactions. This means you’re more likely to have your profile viewed by quality profiles that are aligned with things you value, like your preferences and interests.

### Additional Profiles

One of the best parts about activating Boost is the expansion of reach to a broader audience. This lets your profile be seen by additional profiles and maximizes exposure during peak activity times - particularly if you choose to activate your Boost over a weekend.

### Female Users

Coffee Meets Bagel was designed to [attract and retain](https://www.geekwire.com/2017/dating-app-coffee-meets-bagel-shark-tank-fame-opens-seattle-office-first-beyond-bay-area/)female users due to its focus on quality connections. The team at CMB wants to make the app attractive to girls as well as guys, and they work hard to ensure the genders are both swiping equally. When you Boost your profile, it prioritizes the profile over non-boosted users, increasing the chances of getting matches and being seen by women.

### Long-Term Relationship Goals

Coffee Meets Bagel is not a hookup app like Tinder - it’s designed for those looking for long-term relationships. Using Boost promotes the profile to more users looking for long-term relationships, which increases your chances of discovering that special someone.

## When is the Best Time to Use the CMB Boost Feature?

[Sundays](https://www.cnet.com/culture/internet/dating-sunday-2023-tips-for-making-the-most-of-online-datings-busiest-day/)tend to be the busiest day for online dating app users, but this only works if you’re free to respond to messages! The best time to use this feature is definitely when you know you’ll have the time to be active on the app. If you’re able to use Boost over a weekend, that’s ideal, but if you work weekends or are otherwise busy, choose a different time that works for you.

## 4 Tips To Make Your CMB Boost Profile Worthy

Although Boost can help your profile be seen by more users, it doesn’t do the work for you! If you’re still getting [no matches on CMB](https://thematchartist.com/coffee-meets-bagel/no-matches-on-coffee-meets-bagel), it may mean you need to work on your profile. You need to ensure your profile looks as good as possible before activating the Boost feature, and that mostly comes down to photos.

### Have a Complete Profile

An incomplete profile screams ‘lazy and disinterested’. If you’ve gone to the effort of signing up for online dating, you need to go the extra step and ensure every section of your profile is complete. This improves the likelihood of being noticed and attracts more likes and interactions to your profile.

Make sure your profile reflects your authentic self and lists your preferences, interests, and other details - you’ll see the difference when the notifications of matches come flooding in. Also, don’t forget to be responsive! When you’re chatting with someone on the messaging interface, ensure you reply to their messages and show your interest.

### Get Descriptive in Your CMB Prompts

CMB prompts are designed to help you showcase your personality and demonstrate who you are. Daters with at least one prompt filled out had [22% more](https://coffeemeetsbagel.medium.com/5-tips-to-give-your-profile-the-new-year-refresh-it-deserves-f80cf55c4681) dating success than those who didn’t! Get creative in your answers to increase your chances of getting matches. Share examples of your likes and dislikes, and you increase your chances of finding someone you have compatibility with.

### De-Selfie Your Photo Lineup

While selfies are easy to take and can look good, too many are a turn-off on a dating app. Having full-length, well-framed pictures is something simple you can do to make sure your profile icon receives attention from a wider range of users and amplifies the chances of successful connections.

### Choose Professional Dating Photography Services

Choosing a professional photography service like The Match Artist is a great way to ensure your profile stands out. They’re truly the dating experts, and their photographers are professionally trained and offer unique services such as facial expression coaching to ensure you look your best in your profile pictures. A good profile accelerates the matching process and optimizes the user's presence on the platform.

## How Long Does a Boost Last on Coffee Meets Bagel?

A CMB boost activates for a specific time frame - [48 hours](https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeemeetsbagel/comments/117goo5/how_long_is_a_boost/), or two days. The Boost highlights the user's profile for a limited duration which means views and interactions potentially increase during the Boost period.

## How Much Does Boost Feature Cost?

Any user can purchase a Boost for [750 beans](https://www.vidaselect.com/coffee-meets-bagel-boost/#:~:text=How%20much%20does%20a%20Coffee,you%20to%20use%20the%20Beans.&amp;text=You%20can%20also%20earn%20free,following%20CMB%20on%20social%20media.), and Premium members get one free Boost per month.
