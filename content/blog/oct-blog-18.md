## How Do Matches Work on JSwipe?

JSwipe is an online dating app designed for Jewish men and women looking to find love and marriage. Created by founder [David Yarus](https://www.thejc.com/life-and-culture/j-swipe-founder-may-be-a-matchmaker-but-hes-still-looking-for-love-h8sohhxz) in 2014, JSwipe rapidly grew in popularity following its launch.

Users create a profile page on the app, where they can list information like age, location, dating preferences, and photos. Matching then operates on a swipe system, similar to Tinder.

Users see profiles of potential matches in their search radius. If they like a profile, they swipe right; if not, they swipe left.

If two users swipe right, it’s a match! Once you’ve matched, you can then start swapping messages.

Additional[premium features](https://support.jswipeapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009540020-What-can-I-do-with-a-free-membership-) are available on JSwipe when you purchase a First Class membership. With a free membership, you can send one ‘Super Swipe’ a day.

Super Swipes indicate you’ve already said “Yes” to a member’s profile. With a First Class membership, you get five Super Swipes and the option to send comments with your Swipe.

First Class memberships also include a feature called ‘Passport,’ where you can change your location to anywhere around the world.

As with any dating app, like Tinder, Bumble, or Hinge, you get out of JSwipe what you put in! Reviewing profile pictures and descriptions, adjusting profile settings, and experimenting with bio content are all crucial for attracting matches. Users can also try changing profile photos to test responses or limiting certain filters to see a difference.

## Reasons for No Matches on JSwipe

If you have a problem getting matches, it’s time to change your strategy. Try not to get discouraged by comparing experiences with other JSwipe users. Instead, carefully consider what you’re doing and how to improve your matches.

### Location

Location has a significant impact on your matches on any dating site. If you’ve had similar struggles with matching on [Tinder](https://thematchartist.com/tinder/no-matches-on-tinder) or [Hinge](https://thematchartist.com/hinge/why-am-i-not-getting-matches-hinge/), location could be to blame.

Maybe you’re based in a rural area or an area with a small Jewish community. There’s just not going to be as many options out there. If you’re a man or woman happy with potential long-distance relationships, expanding your search radius can help.

### Profile Settings

Adjusting your profile settings is also a great way to update your matches. Some users may set very restrictive filters, while others prefer a more open-ended approach.

You're within your rights to be picky! And it’s good to know what you want. But having too small a net cast can severely limit your pool of matches.

Try to balance your preferences with an open mind, and your matches will increase.

### Time Period

The time period in which you use JSwipe can also have an impact on your matches. All dating apps tend to be more popular on weekends and evenings. Some even theorize that the [best times](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/relationships/article-11305525/The-best-time-use-Tinder-Bumble-Hinge-matches.html) are Thursday and Sunday evenings.

It’s hard to know if such theories are accurate. But if you’re frustrated with the lack of results, try changing your active times. Using JSwipe when everyone else could make a world of difference.

### Age Range

Reevaluating your personal preferences on JSwipe can also make a difference. Check if you have an overtly restrictive filter for things like age range or religious practices.

Expanding or adjusting the age range could lead to a big increase in matches. Remember that experimenting with different bio contents is the best way to improve your chances of finding a partner.

### Active Users on the App

If you’re frequently swiping right without success, it could be due to a low number of active users on the app. It could be that your preferences are too restrictive, or there is only a small Jewish population in your area.

Refreshing the app to check for updates and staying active in peak times can increase your interaction with active users. Employing smart habits such as these is something that can help you use the app’s algorithm to your advantage.

### Potential Matches in the Area

Your potential matches are a reflection of your filters and preferences. If you have a small number of potentials, it’s a sign to broaden your scope.

Expanding your search radius or reevaluating personal preferences on the app can help. Try discussing JSwipe experiences in your area with friends to see if what you’re experiencing is typical. That way, you can determine if other users face the same issue.

## Actionable Tips to Get More Matches on JSwipe

So, you know why you’re not getting matches, but how can you change things? Whether you’re using Google to find articles on improving match rates or are considering switching to another dating service, There are many options to boost your match rates by a tremendous amount!

### Add An Interesting Bio

Your bio should reflect who you are and increase the interest of possible matches. When experimenting with bio content, ensure your bio reflects your authentic self. That way, someone viewing your profile can clearly understand who you are.

Try seeking advice on profile optimization from friends who’ve been successful when online dating. They’ll be able to help you make your profile stand out!

### Use JSwipe at the Right Time

Ensure you’re active at peak times, such as weekends and evenings. This habit will help you match other user habits and benefit from the app’s algorithm.

Ah, yes, the algorithm. We should clarify that although JSwipe hasn’t stated exactly how it works, in most cases, algorithms reward [frequent engagement](https://www.fastcompany.com/90943919/the-science-behind-why-social-media-algorithms-warp-our-view-of-the-world).

Keep track of trends. Do you get more matches on a particular day? If so, try using the app on that day every week.

### Re-Evaluate Profile Settings

If you’re unhappy with your matches, you should assess and adjust your profile settings to improve your chances. Try changing your age preferences or adjusting your location radius. It’s all about opening yourself up to access more opportunities!

### Paying for a Profile Boost

Paying for a First Class subscription or renewing your subscription in hopes of better visibility is also an option. Using the premium features will make your profile more visible to other users.

Need more certainty about the effectiveness of premium features? A First Class subscription allows more super swipes and lets you change your location to any place in the world! The Passport feature can be helpful if you’re in highly competitive dating pools.

Ultimately, you’re the only one who can decide if a premium membership is worth the money!

### Uploading Professional Dating Photographs

If your profile isn’t bringing success, your profile photos could be the culprit. Sometimes, getting professional photos taken is the only way to go.

No one does this better than the photographers at [The Match Artist](https://thematchartist.com/). With their unique facial expression coaching, your photos will have you looking like the best possible version of yourself!
