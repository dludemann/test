## Can Online Dating Lead to Marriage?

Whether online dating can lead to marriage depends entirely on the person you have matched and started a relationship with. This is the case with any relationship. Whether or not marriage is on the table relies on your connection and compatibility.

The stereotype that online relationships cannot last or lead to marriage is false. There is no reason why someone you meet online can not be your future spouse.

## How Online Dating Affects Marriage Outcomes?

Does meeting online have the potential to impact the outcome of your marriage? [A study](https://news.uchicago.edu/story/meeting-online-leads-happier-more-enduring-marriages) at the University of Chicago says yes – but perhaps not in the way you may expect. Research on sample groups has shown that meeting online often leads to happier, more enduring marriages.

Studies found that not only did couples who met online have a lower divorce rate, but they also reported higher satisfaction rates in their marriage. This success may be why Americans are increasingly turning to online dating. Findings show that more than a third of marriages in the US between 2005 and 2012 began online.

## Advantages of Online Dating

So, aside from producing more happy and successful marriages, what are the other benefits of online dating? As more and more people become online daters, it can be tempting to see what all the fuss is about.

### Increased Accessibility to Partners

As you search for the love of your life, one question may occur to you. With over seven billion people in the world, how likely is it that your soulmate happens to live close by? Online dating lets you connect with people you would never usually talk to.

Drawing from our experience, this dramatically increases your chances of finding someone who you really connect with. Swiping through profiles on a dating app can forgo days spent meeting singles in your area.

### More Variety in Types of Partners and Relationships

Dating apps can connect you with people from all over the country or even all over the world! As such, there are opportunities to meet all types of people.

It doesn’t matter what role you want in a relationship or what type of partner you’re looking for. You’re sure to have luck on a dating app for many reasons.

### Greater Efficiency in Finding Potential Partners

Based on our first-hand experience, dating apps provide you with a far better chance when searching for a partner. In the real world, there are limited ways to meet people. These constraints mean you may miss out on meeting men or women who are perfect for you.

Through the use of technology, a whole new world of romantic connections becomes available. Your dating pool instantly widens when using dating services - networking becomes that much easier! You may network with groups and individuals you would never otherwise meet.

## Disadvantages of Online Dating

While online dating has many advantages, it is also essential to acknowledge the disadvantages of using the internet to find love.

### Lack of Direct Interaction with Potential Partners

One of the critical differences between online dating and [meeting singles in your area](https://thematchartist.com/blog/how-do-i-meet-singles-in-my-area) is the lack of direct interaction. You might meet someone online who’s not in your area and then find it difficult to see them regularly.

Based on our observations, this can often negatively impact a relationship - especially one still in its infancy.

Your partner is often only available to you through words on a screen. As such, it can be challenging to feel a real connection.

### Risk for Fraud and Manipulation by Others

The use of dating apps can also open you up to the risk of being manipulated, catfished, or scammed. While this is not sure to happen to you, these are becoming increasingly common things in the online dating scene.

Some users on dating sites simply use them to find victims to scam out of money. The good news? You can avoid this by being vigilant and knowing [how to tell if you are being catfished](https://thematchartist.com/blog/how-do-i-know-if-im-being-catfished).

### Shared Life Goals

Having shared life goals is another indication that your online relationship could lead to marriage. The two of you must be on the same path in life! If so, it’s not unreasonable to believe a wedding could be on the table.

### Deep Trust and Honesty

As with any relationship, trust and honesty are extremely important. With online relationships, this becomes even more crucial.
