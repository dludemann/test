Let’s get into it!

## What is Coffee Meets Bagel?

Coffee Meets Bagel is a dating app that focuses on quality matches over quantity. It aims to foster relationships and connections. The app was [founded](https://coffeemeetsbagel.com/) by three sisters who were tired of the modern dating scene and aimed to revolutionize how online dating works. The [app’s algorithm](https://thematchartist.com/coffee-meets-bagel/how-does-coffee-meets-bagel-work) curates potential matches (called Bagels) and presents users with a small number of carefully chosen profiles. This ensures your matches are based on mutual interests and you don’t get overwhelmed by choice.

### The popularity of the App

While CMB may not be as popular as apps like Tinder and Bumble, it is definitely popular among those looking for long-term relationships. With its curated matches and focus on connection, it’s a great way to find like-minded people and relationships.

## Understanding the Platform of Coffee Meets Bagel

To have a chance at love and dating success with CMB, it's important to understand how the platform works. From the matching process to the way premium subscriptions work, it’s essential to understand the app’s processes.

### Matching Process

The matching process is what sets CMB apart - [here’s how it works](https://coffeemeetsbagel.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019599254-What-is-Coffee-Meets-Bagel)! Every day, you will receive a small batch of potential matches hand-picked for you. These profiles are picked using CMB’s smart algorithm that takes your preferences into account and finds matches that are designed to be compatible.

CMB encourages you to carefully review your potential match’s account information, photos, interests, and preferences before making your decision. When two users like each other, a match is made, which then opens up a chat window. This will be accompanied by conversation prompts (icebreakers) to give you something to chat about initially, but you can choose your own conversation topic, of course!

### Mutual Likes & Connections

When two users are interested in each other thanks to mutual interests and connections, they each hit the heart icon. This enables you to chat with your match and get to know each other.

### Differentiation Between Free and Premium Subscriptions

While it’s possible to use CMB successfully with only the basic, free version, a premium subscription has many advantages. With a Premium subscription, users can like more profiles in the Discover section without spending any Beans (beans are CMB’s in-app currency). Premium accounts also get a big discount on beans, which allows users to purchase more likes and features. Premium accounts also have access to read receipts and get several profile boosts each month, which improves the chances of everyone seeing your profile!

## How to See Likes on Coffee Meets Bagel

When you [like](https://coffeemeetsbagel.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020875914-What-does-it-mean-to-Like-a-bagel) someone on CMB, it indicates that you’re interested in them. It’s completely free if you’re sending it from your Suggested Bagels - these are the curated recommendations that CMB sends you every day. If the person likes you back, then it’s a match! If someone has liked you from the Discover page, this shows up in your Likes You tab - more on that below!

### How Do Likes Work on Coffee Meets Bagel?

In our view, likes on CMB are pretty self-explanatory! You can send likes from either the Discover[or suggested](https://coffeemeetsbagel.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020785714-What-is-the-difference-between-Suggested-and-Discover) areas of CMB - to send a like from suggested is free, but to send one from Discover costs Beans. When you like the look of a profile, just tap on the heart icon and it sends a like to the person. This is the perfect way to show someone you want to get to know them and start a conversation.

### Where is the "Likes You" Tab on CMB?

The [Likes You](https://coffeemeetsbagel.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19345933037459-Why-can-t-I-see-my-likes-in-Likes-You) feature in CMB is only available to premium members. If you’re already a premium subscriber, you can find the Likes You tab in the bottom navigation corner of the screen. The tab is a space where you can view likes in the app, check for new likes daily, and receive notifications of likes. It’s an easy place to notice who has liked your profile and observe the number of likes you’ve received.

## What Happens When Someone Likes You on CMB?

When someone likes you on CMB, those likes will be stored in the ‘Likes You’ section. If the person that likes you is someone you’ve already liked, a match will be made and a chat window will open. The Likes You section lets you recognize profiles showing interest - if you like them back, you can message each other. Monitoring likes on your account helps you increase your matches and chances of a relationship.

## Do You Have to Pay to See Likes on Coffee Meets Bagel?

You do have to pay to access the Likes You tab - this is only available for Premium subscribers. There is an exception to this, however - if someone in your Likes You tab has sent you a flower, then their profile will be unblurred and you will be able to like them back.

## What Should You Do If You are Not Getting Likes?

We’ve gone over how to see your likes, but what if you [don’t have any likes or matches](https://thematchartist.com/coffee-meets-bagel/no-matches) to see? Although this can be disheartening, there are ways to improve your profile and increase your chances of getting likes.

### Write a Comprehensive Bio

A good bio is a perfect opportunity to demonstrate your interests, personality, and more. Users are more likely to be attracted to profiles that put in effort and are comprehensive. Make sure you include info about your hobbies and important information like your height and age. This can help you find mutual interests and increase the chance of getting likes.

### Choose Good Photos to Include

In our experience, photos are the single most important part of a good dating app profile. Your profile pictures should clearly show what you look like, while also being flattering and engaging. So many guys and women make the mistake of having subpar pictures on their profiles, and it can really harm their chances of dating success. If you’re struggling to take photos that really show what you look like, try using the professional photographers at The Match Artist!

Some of our top tips for ensuring you have good photos include avoiding selfies, making sure you don’t have too many photos featuring others (like friends or family) and ensuring your photos showcase the things you’re interested in.

## How Many Likes Can You See on Coffee Meets Bagel?

This depends on the type of account you have! With a Premium subscription, you can see an unlimited number of accounts in the Likes You tab. If, however, you have a free version, you’ll only be able to see the profiles who have also sent you flowers.
