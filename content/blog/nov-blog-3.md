## What is Coffee Meets Bagel?

The dating app Coffee Meets Bagel was founded in 2012 to help singles seeking a committed, long-term relationship. Many other dating apps are used primarily to have casual flings. However, Coffee Meets Bagel prioritizes quality over quantity and aims to help users form serious relationships.

### How Does Coffee Meets Bagel Work?

[Coffee Meets Bagel works uniquely](https://thematchartist.com/coffee-meets-bagel/how-does-coffee-meets-bagel-work). The user experience differs slightly for men and women, respectively. Each day, men are presented with 21 potential matches, or ‘bagels,’ and can then indicate who they are interested in.

After this, women on the app are presented with a curated list of 6 potential matches to select those they are interested in. Once the woman has liked one of her ‘bagels,’ a match is instantly formed. After a match is formed, the two users can start a conversation.

## What is Hinge?

Hinge is a popular dating app with over 23 million users worldwide. Hinge is well-known for hosting a range of users looking for different relationships. From serious, committed partnerships to casual flings - Hingle covers a number of relationships.

### How Does Hinge Work?

Based on our firsthand experience, Hinge works [very simply](https://thematchartist.com/hinge/how-to-use-hinge) and has an easy-to-use interface. You’re shown one user at a time and can either ‘like’ or dismiss their profile.

However, two distinct features make Hinge particularly unique: ‘prompts’ and specific ‘profile likes.’ Prompts allow you to answer tailored questions to add interesting facts to your bio. The profile-like feature will enable you to like particular parts of a user's profile rather than the entire thing.

## Hinge vs. Coffee Meets Bagel: Comparison of Core Features

Several differences between Hinge and Coffee Meets Bagel may influence which one you choose to sign up for. Choosing the right dating app for you can make a lot of difference to your dating prospects.

### Age Range

One key difference between the two apps is the standard age of the user base. The majority of users on both of these apps are between 30 and 49 years old.

However, Hinge has a higher percentage of younger users on the app, ranging from 18 to 29. Only 2% of Hinge users are over 50 years old. Around 7% of Coffee Meets Bagel users are over 50.

### Popularity

When it comes to popularity, Hinge wins the battle against Coffee Meets Bagel with ease. With around 23 million users, Hinge’s user base is hard to beat. Coffee Meets Bagel’s smaller user base means fewer opportunities to meet people.

### Demographics

Sisters Arum, Soo, and Dawoon Kang created Coffee Meets Bagel to help singles find committed, long-term relationships. As such, most of the users on the app are looking for something serious. Hinge, on the other hand, is often used for various people looking for casual and serious relationships.

### Activity Reports & Detailed Profiles

Hinge and Coffee Meets Bagel have unique features that help you learn essential information about other users. For instance, if you invest in Coffee Meets Bagel Premium, you can see other users’ ‘activity reports.’

These reports include insights into the user’s habits. For example, the percentage of the matches they engage with and the average time it takes for them to reply.

Hinge offers the opportunity to create detailed profiles and give likes for specific content on these profiles. Upon signing up to Hinge, you will be given a range of prompts to fill out.

These prompts reveal information about yourself and your personality. When checking out another user's profile, you can also like individual photos and specific prompts that they have filled out.

### Daily Matches & Mutual Match System

Based on our observations, Hinge and Coffee Meets Bagel function slightly differently regarding the matching process. Hinge allows you to send eight likes per day – if a user likes you back, it is a mutual match.

However, with Hinge, you do not need to match with a user to send them messages. A like is all that is required on Hinge for you to be able to message someone.

Coffee Meets Bagel delivers potential matches every day at noon. For men, 21 potential matches - bagels - are delivered. Men can then select their favorite bagels from this curated list.

Women are presented with a curated list of their top six potential matches. They can then choose to like any of them. A match is made once a woman likes a profile.

### Filters & Additional Premium Filters

Hinge's premium and standard filters differ slightly from those on Coffee Meets Bagel.

The standard filters available on Hinge are as follows:

* Location
* Gender
* Age
* Max Distance Range
* Ethnicity
* Religion

If you sign up for a Hinge premium membership, you will gain access to the following exclusive filters:

* Height
* Family Plans
* Children
* Politics
* Education

Coffee Meets Bagel, on the other hand, has the following standard filter options:

* Gender
* Age
* Height
* Distance
* Ethnicity
* Religion

If you subscribe to Coffee Meets Bagel Premium, two additional filters will become available to you:

* Degrees
* Active within the last 72 hours

These filters allow you to tailor the accounts you see. Hinge will show you users that fit your preferences as closely as possible. However, sometimes, they may not fit every preference you have selected.

If you don’t want to see users outside your filtered preferences, you can select ‘dealbreakers.’ When a dealbreaker is selected, Hinge will not show you users who do not comply with this filter.

Coffee Meets Bagel will only present you with potential matches that fit all of your filtered preferences exactly. You can browse other users who do not fit all of your preferences in the ‘Discover’ section on the app.

### Premium Features

The premium features offered by the premium subscriptions of Hinge and Coffee Meets Bagel differ significantly.

With Hinge+, you will be able to access the following premium features:

* Advanced filter acces

HingeX is an even more advanced subscription tier. Along with all of the features from Hinge+, HingeX will also provide you with:
