Let’s dive right in!

## What Is Bumble?

[Bumble](https://bumble.com/en-us) is more than just a dating app — it’s a platform where making genuine connections is the goal, and they hope to empower their users.

Of course, that’s a pretty big claim. But Bumble’s a little different from other dating apps. Created by an ex-Tinder founder, the app caters towards women in heterosexual matches, only allowing them to make the first move once a match is made.

The idea was to prevent some of the more abusive and harassing behavior women encountered on other dating apps. By putting the messaging privileges in their hands, the hope is that women can have more control over the direction of the conversation.

In non-heterosexual matches, where women are involved, they’ll have first messaging rights, otherwise both parties will have first messaging rights.

On Bumble there’s a lot more to the app than meets the eye. They don’t just cater to singles, nor do they classify themselves as a dating app. Instead, they’re a social network, also offering their services Bumble BFF (designed for you to meet new friends) and Bumble Bizz (designed for you to meet new potential business partners and contacts).

With these three different Bumble modes to choose from, users can make connections in all aspects of their lives. They can even become [Bumble Bizz Ambassadors](https://bumble.com/en/the-buzz/bumble-honey-queen-bee), to help spread information about Bumble to their communities!

### How Does Bumble Work?

Like Tinder, Bumble takes a [swipe-based approach](https://thematchartist.com/bumble/how-does-bumble-work/). You browse profiles and swipe right if you’re interested, and left if not. If two users are on the same page and swipe right on each other, that’s a match!

For Bumble Date, women send the first message (in heterosexual matches). They have 24 hours to do this before the match disappears.

There are exceptions to this, with [Bumble Boost and Bumble Premium](https://bumble.com/en/help/what-is-bumble-boost) giving options to extend the 24-hour limit — just in case you need a bit more time to craft your perfect first messages!

Of course, just setting up a Bumble profile doesn’t guarantee success. You’ll need to make sure you’ve fully filled out your profile, written a stellar bio that gives potential matches plenty to latch onto for a conversation starter, and your photos will have to be totally swipe-right worthy!

While we can’t help you with the profile creation and bio, at The Match Artist, we can definitely help with the photos!

Our professional photographers will work with you to take a range of photos in your very own personal photoshoot. Not only will you be looking and *feeling* amazing throughout your shoot, after we’ve edited the images and got them back to you, you’ll be blown away by the difference it makes to your matches!

Honestly, *it really is that simple!*

Just check out what our [past clients](https://thematchartist.com/reviews) have had to say about it!

## Understanding Bumble’s Swiping Mechanism

Bumble’s swiping mechanism is your key to [making connections](https://thematchartist.com/bumble/bumble-for-guys/), but you need to understand it to make sure it works for you.

Let’s break it down!

### How Bumble Swiping Works

The swiping mechanism is super simple and, if you’ve been on other dating apps in the past, it’ll feel very familiar.

See a profile you like? Swipe right. Not keen on a profile? Swipe left.

This filters potential matches quickly and easily — it’s intuitive and fun.

### Swipe Right

Swipe right to “like” someone. If they also swipe right on your profile, voilà! It’s a match and you’ll be put into a private messaging room.

In a heterosexual match, women will have first message privileges, so if you’re a guy, you’ll have to sit back and wait for that message to come through!

### Swipe Left

Swipe left if you’re not interested in the profile. No harm done, they won’t know. The next profile then pops up.

### Does Bumble Show the Same Person Twice?

There is no clear data on this, but usually no, provided there are other profiles from your area that you haven’t seen yet.

However, if a user creates a new account, or you run out of new users in your area, you may see the same person more than once.

## Bumble’s Backtrack Feature

[Backtrack](https://bumble.com/en/the-buzz/thank-god-for-backtrack)is Bumble’s lifeline for those hasty swipes. Let’s dive deeper into what it is and how to use it.

## What Is Bumble Backtrack?

Available only on Bumble Boost and [Bumble Premium](https://thematchartist.com/bumble/bumble-premium/), Bumble Backtrack is a feature that lets you undo your last swipe. It’s the rewind button for your swipe mistakes!

### How to Return to a Bumble Profile You Just Passed On?

We’ve all been there — you’re swiping on Bumble and see the perfect guy or girl. You go to swipe right, but your finger slips and you accidentally swipe left instead! *Yikes!*

Well, don’t panic. If you use Bumble Backtrack, you can immediately undo your last swipe and return to the profile.

### How to Undo Your Last Left Swipe on Bumble

Made a mistake with a left swipe? No problem! While you can’t swipe to Backtrack, undoing your last swipe is just as easy.

If you’re on your mobile device (either iOS or Android), simply tap the arrow in the top left corner of your screen.

If you’re using Bumble Web, click on the two arrows next to the “X” icon on Bumble Web, and you can undo your last swipe.

As part of Bumble Boost and Bumble Premium, you have unlimited Backtracks to keep your dating experience strong.

## Utilizing Backtrack

So we know you can use Backtrack if you accidentally swipe left, but how else can you use it?

Let’s break it down!

### How to Use Bumble Backtrack

Undo a left swipe by tapping the arrow in the top left corner of your Apple iPhone or Android screen. If you’re on Bumble Web, tap the two arrows next to the “X” icon.

And the best part? Backtrack is unlimited, so if you accidentally swiped left on a string of profiles, you can undo your mistakes and get another chance!

### Can You Use Backtrack to Undo a Right Swipe?

No, unfortunately, Backtrack only works for left swipes. Right swipes and Bumble SuperSwipes stay put, so choose wisely!

### Can You Backtrack on Likes?

Unfortunately, no, you can’t Backtrack on your likes. Once you swipe right or “like” someone, it’s out there. No taking it back, even with Backtrack.

If you do match with someone, you can choose to unmatch or block them, however.

### Can You Take Back a Bumble SuperSwipe?

Again, unfortunately no, you can’t take back Bumble SuperSwipes.

As with the standard right swipe, SuperSwipes are final, and once you’ve used one, you can’t undo it.

Even better reason to use your SuperSwipes thoughtfully!

## When Backtrack Doesn’t Work

Is Backtrack not working? It happens sometimes, and usually it’s an easy fix!

Here are our top tips.

### Why Is My Bumble Backtrack Not Working?

Backtrack activates after you swipe once in each direction. If you swipe “yes” or close the app, you can’t backtrack on earlier “no” swipes.

If you’ve done all this and the arrow doesn’t appear, you could be facing an issue.

### What to Do If Backtrack Is Not Working?

If you’re facing a glitch and [Backtrack isn’t working](https://bumble.com/en/help/backtrack-isnt-working), try following these steps:

* Go to the settings menu and sign out of Bumble
* Delete the Bumble app
* Clear your web browser’s cookies and cache (if you’re not sure how to do this for your particular browser, you can get the details from your search engine)
* Redownload Bumble, either from the Google Play or App Store (depending on whether you’re looking for an Android or iOS download)
* Sign back in
* Swipe right once, then left.

### 9 Ways to Fix Bumble Backtrack Not Working

Not sure why Bumble Backtrack isn’t working? Here are some common methods to get it back up and running:

1. Sign out and sign back into Bumble
2. Delete and reinstall the app on your smartphone
3. Clear cookies and cache on your website browser
4. Check the status of your Bumble Boost or Premium subscription (keep in mind that Backtrack is not available for users of the free version of the app)
5. Make sure you’ve swiped both ways at least once before trying to use Backtrack
6. Restart your device
7. Check if any app updates need installing
8. Double check your internet connection
9. Contact Bumble Support and send them a screenshot of the issue if it persists.

## Common Questions About Swiping

Swiping on Bumble can feel like a bit of a mystery sometimes! Luckily, we’ve got the answers to your most commonly asked questions.

### Does Bumble Ever Reset Left Swipes?

Bumble doesn’t officially reset left swipes. However, due to the large user base, you could end up seeing your left swipes again one day!

### Does Bumble Bring Back Left Swipes?

There’s no surefire way to say. Some [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/xfq4mh/reset_swipes/) users report seeing profiles they’ve swiped left on again. But don’t count on it as a rule.

### If You Swipe Left on Bumble, Are They Gone Forever?

Not necessarily! While it will remove them from your stack in the short term, their profile may come round again if you’ve swiped through all other users in your area. The longer you wait, the more likely you are to see the profile again.

## Dealing with Accidental Swipes

Oops! You swiped the wrong way on Bumble. Don’t worry, it happens! Here’s what to do.

### Accidentally Swiped Right on Bumble

Weren’t paying attention to things and accidentally swiped right? Sorry, but it’s final. Bumble doesn’t let you backtrack a right swipe.

All you can do is hope they don’t also swipe right on you. If they do and you match, you can always unmatch or block the other user.

### Bumble — What to Do If You Accidentally Swiped Left on Bumble

An accidental left swipe is no problem as long as you have Bumble Boost or Bumble Premium!

Just tap the arrow on the top left corner of your screen in order to use the Backtrack feature. It’s your unlimited undo button for left swipes!

### How to Undo an Accidental Swipe with Bumble Backtrack

Accidental left swipe? Just tap the arrow on the top left-hand corner of your screen. It’s the Backtrack button to rewind your last “no”.

For Bumble Web, tap the two arrows next to the “X” icon.

## Advanced Bumble Tips

Want to up your Bumble game? Here are some of our best tips that could help you!

### Bumble Pro Tips: Swiping Too Fast? Backtrack for a Second Chance

Quick swipes can lead to regret. But with Backtrack, you have the ability to undo those hasty “no”s.

Just tap the arrow on the top left corner of your screen and, in the future, swipe with care!

### Want More Matches?

If you want more matches, you’ll need to put your best foot forward from the start.

The best thing you can do is ensure your profile is high quality and reflects who you are as a person. Fill out all the sections and list all your interests so that potential matches can get to know you.

Another hot tip is to make sure you use good English — some people find bad spelling and grammar very off putting!

You can also try linking your profile to your social media, such as your Instagram, Facebook, or Pinterest accounts so that users can get to know the real you a little better. However, be aware that once you’ve linked your social media accounts, you’re opening yourself up to the world, so be careful what you share!

Ultimately, we know that the best thing you can do to get more and higher-quality matches is to make sure that your photos make you impossible to swipe left on! While you could rope in a friend with a quality camera, or take some DSLR selfies, an even better idea is to get in touch with The Match Artist!

We cover everything, from what you’re looking for, to what to wear, how to pose, and even facial expression coaching to make sure that every intention is visible on your face! And while there’s a little homework required (pull out that mirror and practice your Blue Steel), we’re there on hand for you, before, during, and after your shoot to make sure that your images are perfect.

Pictures are part of the story you tell about yourself, so make sure they properly reflect who you are!

### Find Exactly What You’re Looking For

To narrow down your search and find exactly what you’re looking for in a match, try Bumble’s advanced filters. You can refine your potential matches by age, location, what they’re looking for, and more.

## Key Takeaways

Bumble’s a social networking app that lets women make the first move with Bumble Date. It works by swiping — left for a no, right for a yes.

In case you accidentally swipe left, you can use Bumble Backtrack to undo it. However, this feature is only available on the Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost subscriptions. Backtrack also only works for left swipes, not for accidental right swipes or Superswipes, so be mindful with your swiping!

If you’re using the free version of the app and you swipe left accidentally, the profile you passed on might come back around in your queue — however, there’s no guarantee.

If Backtrack doesn’t work, you can try reinstalling the app and clearing the cookies and cache.

And remember, the bottom line when it comes to matches is making sure your profile photos are *excellent!* So, get the professionals involved, and [get in touch with The Match Artist today](https://thematchartist.com/online-dating-photographer-near-me)! We’ll get you more matches — [trust us](https://thematchartist.com/case-studies)!
