Vacation and hobby pictures are also great. Each photo should add another layer to your story. Inform potential matches of who you are and what you enjoy.

## Avoiding Common Mistakes in Tinder Photography

* **Confusing group photos**: ** ** Group photos can be fun to include, but make sure you have plenty of solo shots. That way, potential matches can tell which person you are! Only including group shots can get pretty confusing for other users.
* **Cliche poses**: ** ** Flexing at the gym may seem like a great way to show off your hard-earned gains, but it’s a bit of a turnoff online. We hate to say it, but leave the[**fish photos**](https://www.thecut.com/2018/02/why-dating-apps-are-full-of-guys-with-fish-photos.html) out, too!
* **Photos with the opposite sex**: ** ** This one should be obvious, but pictures with your ex or friend of the opposite sex can be off-putting to potential partners. Keep your pictures solo or with groups.
* **Overly filtered pictures**: Authenticity is important in online dating. Overly filtered pictures make it look like you’re hiding something. Be proud of your true self, and others will love it.
