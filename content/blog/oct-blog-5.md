## What Is Dating?

So, what actually is dating? While [definitions vary](https://www.essence.com/love/relationships/what-does-dating-actually-mean-we-asked-six-staffers-and-got-six-different-answers/#125108), the commonly held definition is when you’re actively spending time with or courting people with the intention of beginning a romantic relationship. The dating period of a relationship is when you look at compatibility between yourself and potential partners, including looking at things and hobbies you might have in common.

Dating is an exciting period, full of both possibility and rejection, but it is a necessary step towards finding a partner. Look at dating as a way to explore the dating pool — you go out on dates with a variety of singles to look for people you can have meaningful conversations with. If you’re lucky, it can even lead to love and the start of a relationship!

## When Should You Start Dating?

When you’re at a stage in your life when you find yourself wondering “Where can I meet potential partners?”, it’s a pretty good sign you’re ready to start dating. When you feel like you’re ready to explore relationships and go into the dating world with a clear mind and open heart, you’re ready to begin.

Dating can be fraught with a lot of minefields. You may wonder “How can I make a good first impression on a date?” and “What topics are safe to discuss on a first date?". Probably the biggest question of all, is “How do I know if someone is genuinely interested in me?”. With a little preparation and reflection, you can ensure you’re ready to answer these questions and enter the dating pool.

## Preparing to Date

Before beginning to date, you need to prepare yourself! Dating is not just about meeting lots of people, it’s about making connections with the right person. A good place to start is reading this article about [what makes a good first date](https://thematchartist.com/blog/what-is-a-good-first-date) to get ideas.

### Reflect on Previous Relationships

Reflecting on your past relationships, particularly your breakups, is a great way to prepare. Ask yourself “What have I learned from my past relationships?” and “How can I handle rejection gracefully?”. Reflecting on past relationships helps to bring clarity to your [dating patterns](https://medium.com/hello-love/the-4-most-common-toxic-dating-patterns-and-how-to-identify-them-2bfd80fb5cd5), and helps you avoid dating mistakes in future relationships.

### Get Clear on Your Goals

You won’t achieve your dating goals if you aren’t clear on what they are. Think about what you’re looking for — is it casual dating without strong feelings, a partnership, or marriage and a family? Make sure you can answer the question “How do I differentiate between casual dating and a serious relationship?” — you need to define what this will look like for you.

### Create a List of Qualities You Are Looking for in a Partner

Although it’s important to be flexible when looking for a partner, everyone has dealbreakers. Defining these early on is a great way to find a good match that aligns with your values and preferences.

## How to Start Dating the Right Way

Entering the dating world can be exciting, but also a little scary! To ensure you have a positive and successful dating experience, it’s essential to do a little preparation so that you can ensure you start dating the right way.

### Sign Up for an Online Dating Profile

Signing up for an online dating profile is a great way to meet potential partners. It’s an ideal way to [meet singles in your area](https://thematchartist.com/blog/how-do-i-meet-singles-in-my-area), with [more than half](https://www.forbes.com/health/dating/dating-statistics/)of single adults in the USA having used a dating app. Many dating sites are free for a basic profile, so you’ve got nothing to lose!

### Work With a Matchmaker

For a more personalized service that includes tailored dating advice, you can try working with a matchmaker. You can often find their services in the personals section of your local newspaper. You can also try making use of a service like The Match Artist, which focuses on making sure your dating profile pictures are the best they can be.

### In-Person Meetups

In-person meetups may feel daunting, but they’re a great way to meet new people and make new friendships. Practice makes perfect, and the more of this type of event you go to, the more confident you’ll feel.

### Learn to Flirt

Flirting is an essential skill in dating — it’s how you [express interest](https://thematchartist.com/blog/how-to-flirt-with-a-girl) in a fun and lighthearted manner. It’s the perfect way for anyone to subtly convey that they like someone, without coming on too strong.

### Give Your Number Out First

Taking the initiative and handing out your number first is very attractive, as it shows confidence and interest.

### Ask Someone on a Date

Asking someone on a date may be daunting, but this straightforward approach is an excellent way to show you’re serious. With many people in the dating scene tired of a lack of commitment, showing you’re willing to make the first move is a great way to stand out.

### Be Open-Minded

Dating is all about having new experiences and meeting different people. Be open-minded to people who have different interests from you — sometimes, opposites attract!

### Don’t Skip the Sex Talk

Sexual compatibility is important, and it’s essential to find out the attitudes your dates have when it comes to sex. If you’re looking for something casual, you want to make sure you’re not dating someone who doesn’t believe in sex before marriage.

### Meet Each Other’s Friends

Once you’ve been dating a while, it’s a good move to meet each other’s friends to get a sense of who they really are. Friends can show valuable insights into a person’s values and what they think is important. If you’ve been wondering “What are some red flags to watch out for when dating?”, meeting friends is particularly crucial. If someone’s friends are not good people, there’s a risk your date is not a good person either.

### Be Yourself

The question “How can I build trust and rapport with someone new?” can be answered pretty simply — be yourself! Authenticity is key to forming lasting connections, and also the key to attracting like-minded people.

## Five Great First Date Ideas

There’s a lot of pressure surrounding the first date. It can set the tone for a future relationship, and be the deciding factor in whether anything further happens.

### Dinner Date

Dinner dates are great for in-depth conversations and getting to know someone. You may be a bit unsure about what topics are safe to discuss on a first date, but nothing should be off-limits. You’re wanting to get to know someone, and if there are any dealbreakers, it’s better to know early on.

### Stroll in a Park

A walk in the park is a good, low-stakes first-date idea that gives both parties plenty of time to get to know the other person. The natural setting is calming and conducive to opening up and sharing experiences. If the stroll is combined with getting coffee or ice cream, that’s even better!

### Volunteer and Date

This is a great way to see how your date interacts with other people and to spend meaningful time together. If volunteering and giving back to your community is important to you, this is a great way to see if your date shares your values.

### Visit a Brewery

The ideal first date for a craft beer enthusiast! Visiting a brewery is a relaxed, fun experience, that encourages conversation and sharing anecdotes. Just make sure no one drinks too much!

### Have a Picnic

Organizing a picnic for your date is a great way to demonstrate that you can be thoughtful and charming. Choose a beautiful outdoor setting as the backdrop, but make sure it’s in a [public place](https://www.columbiaspectator.com/spectrum/2023/02/05/8-tips-for-your-next-first-date/#:~:text=Meet%20in%20a%20public%20place,make%20you%20feel%20more%20comfortable.), especially when meeting strangers! If you consider “What steps should I take to ensure my safety when dating?”, it’s evident that you shouldn’t go somewhere *too* secluded.

## How to Start Dating Again After a Breakup

In our experience, re-entering the dating scene after a breakup is very challenging, particularly if you’ve been part of a couple for a long time. It’s key to guarantee you have healed properly from the breakup and that you’re ready to date again before you begin. If you still see yourself as the victim of a failed love story, then you’re definitely not ready!

### Heal from the Past

Make sure you understand the lessons you learned from your previous relationship. Don’t jump straight into dating while you’re still in the grieving phase, take time to process and sit with the pain for a while.

### Figure Out What You Want

Finding out what you want is necessary. Ask yourself the following questions before you even consider starting dating again:

* How soon is it appropriate to discuss exclusivity?
* How often should I communicate with someone I’ve just started dating?
* How can I handle rejection gracefully?

For example, when you can answer questions regarding what you’re looking for and how you want your dating experience to proceed, you’re ready to start dating again.

### Boost Your Self-Confidence

Focus on your strengths, and remember that you’re the author of your own story! A great way to boost your confidence is to ensure your dating profile pictures truly reflect how you look. The Match Artist uses professional photography and facial expression coaching to make you look the best you’ve ever looked in a picture!

### Stop Feeling Desperate for Love

Sadly, desperation is a very unattractive quality. It can also lead to making bad choices and choosing people that are not right for you. Understand how to be happy while single, and you’ll be more able to make good decisions and attract the right people.

### Have No Attachment to the Outcome

Dating is somewhat of a numbers game. If you put too much attachment on the outcome of a date, that’s too much pressure. Look at dating as an experience, and a way to meet new people. If you proceed without the expectation of love and commitment right away, you might even have fun!

## How Do Introverts Start Dating?

Online dating platforms are ideal for introverts, as they allow you to communicate through online chats and messages before meeting in person. Connecting through shared hobbies is also an excellent option for introverts, as it gives you an activity to focus on rather than the entire focus being conversation. Introverts also need to ensure they pace themselves, as too many highly social activities over a week can leave them feeling [drained](https://psychcentral.com/blog/social-exhaustion-avoiding-introvert-burnout#:~:text=When%20introverts%20don't%20get,exhaustion%20doesn't%20happen%20overnight.).

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### What is the normal age to start dating?

There isn’t a normal age to start dating — some people start dating in high school, while others wait for college or after they leave home. It’s based on what you feel comfortable with. Make sure you consider “How can I manage my expectations when entering the dating scene?”. Dating requires emotional maturity and if you don’t feel ready, it’s better to wait.

Dating can be awkward, but don’t let that put you off. You’ll grow in confidence the more experienced you get. Just make sure you don’t put too much pressure on yourself, and remember, everyone feels awkward, not just you!

The [right dating app](https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-apps) is a matter of personal preference.
