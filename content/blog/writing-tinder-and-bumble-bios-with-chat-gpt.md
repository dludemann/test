The new AI age is here, and the hype about Chat GPT is huge these days. We've been using it at The Match Artist to help with ideas for new content and a number of other things. I was wondering about its capability to write online dating bios for different styles of people, and it's been really helpful so far. Rather than finding a bumble profile writing service, you can power your online experience with a chatgpt dating profile.&nbsp;

Even if you have great photos, that's just the first part of the funnel. Once the prospective match likes your photos, it's on to make sure there's nothing weird in your bio. If you can give them a laugh or show them you're clever, you'll have a better shot at getting to that date.

# Examples of Online Dating Bios with Chat GPT

Feel free to use some of these, but you can also use this great tool to make your own.

### For the Cultured Person

"Always on the hunt for the next adventure. Connoisseur of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (insert favorite type of cuisine or drink), always on the lookout for the latest and greatest restaurants, and never satisfied until I've explored every corner of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (insert favorite travel destination). In my free time, you can find me \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (insert cultural pursuit or hobby), sipping on a glass of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (insert favorite type of wine or drink), or trying to convince the Mona Lisa to smile.

In search of a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (insert personality trait, e.g. sassy, cultured, well-traveled) partner who appreciates the finer things in life and isn't afraid to dance on the wild side. Let's order every starter at that new spot down the block.

## What about Match.com, Hinge, Eharmony, and Coffee Meets Bagel?

Maybe you've written your ChatGPT Bumble Bio, but you're looking for how it can be useful for other dating apps. Many apps are laid out differently, so the ChatGPT Tinder bio won't work the same. We've found that chat gpt dating advice actually works well for hinge and bumble prompts. We'll have a prompt guide coming soon, but for now, ask gpt to write you some examples for the prompts you'd like to use, and give it context about what type of person you are.

### Experimenting with ChatGPT for Bumble and Tinder

Each of my prompts for Chat GPT revolved around asking it to give me bio templates with examples. If you're trying this yourself, make sure to mess around with the contextual awareness that it's capable of. If you don't like a part that it spit out, you can say something like, "The same thing, but change x sentence." Or if you generally like what it put out, you can reply with something like, "Now write the same thing, but make it wittier, or funnier, or whatever you want more of in your bio.
