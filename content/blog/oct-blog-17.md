# No Matches on Bumble? Here’s How to Get More Matches

Want to increase those matches on Bumble? We’re here to help! We’ve got the know-how on Bumble’s matching process algorithm and how to maximize the potential benefits.

You probably know the feeling of swiping right continuously, sure that the perfect someone is a single swipe away. But for all your effort in searching for matches, you can’t help feeling disappointed with the outcome, or lack thereof. Luckily, for every problem, there is a solution - and we’ve got you covered!

In this article, we’ll cover:

* How matches work on Bumble
* Some key reasons why you might not be getting matches on Bumble
* Some simple steps to help stop the frustrating ordeal of getting no matches
* Some frequently asked questions.

Let’s get into it!

## How Do Matches Work on Bumble?

Bumble’s matching process resembles other dating apps such as Tinder, OKCupid, and Hinge. You see profiles and can swipe up from the profile photos to see more details. From there, you can swipe right to attempt to match or swipe left to skip.

However, that’s where the similarities end. Once you match on Bumble, things get a little bit different!

One of Bumble’s most publicized features is that it requires the woman to make the first move in heterosexual matches. In same-gender matches, either party can start.

Once a conversation has been initiated, the other party has 24 hours to respond. If the other party doesn’t, then the match is canceled.

## Does Bumble Shadow Ban You?

There are conflicting opinions on whether Bumble employs shadow ban techniques or not. A shadow ban, for those not in the know, limits how well you can interact with a digital service. For instance, the quality of the service you experience may decrease, or the app might noticeably slow.

Bumble [denies that they shadow-ban users](https://bumble.com/en-au/help/am-i-penalized-for-deleting-profile) but admits that some behaviors on the app can cause reduced interaction. This changed experience can often be perceived as a shadow ban and might as well be considered one.

If you’re wondering about profile visibility - maybe the number of matches you get has dropped a lot recently. You might be feeling the effects of either a real or pseudo-shadow ban.

However, It’s important first to check whether your experience is not just a profile or software problem. Try comparing your experience with other dating apps and checking for app updates.

It may be that you’re not getting matches on other dating apps like [Tinder](https://thematchartist.com/tinder/tinder-likes-but-no-matches) and [Hinge](https://thematchartist.com/hinge/why-am-i-not-getting-matches-hinge/#How-Hinge-Works). If this is the case, you might have an issue with your profiles in general. [Luckily, we’ve got the solution for that, too!](https://thematchartist.com/blog/no-matches-on-dating-apps)

## Reasons for No Matches on Bumble

There could be many reasons why you are not getting matches on Bumble. So, how do you fix the “no matches” issue? The first step is identifying some of these potential issues.

Let’s go through some!

### Incomplete Profile Information

You probably don’t look twice at a profile without any important information attached to it. The same can be said for other people viewing your profile.

Incomplete profile information can often be a sign of a bot or catfish. Of course, it’s hard to get matches if people are skeptical about your profile!

Plus, if you haven’t listed many interests in your Bumble profile, it will be hard for others to make meaningful connections with you. People will look to your profile information for conversation starters. Many conversations, both in the online and real world, revolve around shared hobbies and activities.

### Missing Profile Picture

A missing profile picture is another strong indicator that something might be wrong with a profile. If you don’t have one, you’re setting yourself back. People don’t know who they’re engaging with or if you’re even a real person!

You might be struggling to find a good picture of yourself to use. However, drawing from our experience, we can confidently say that anything is better than nothing.

### Your Profile Bio Lacks Creativity

Think about the last time someone grabbed your attention with their profile bio. Really grabbed your attention. What was it like?

Odds are, the bio was inventive, unique, and probably funny. You should strive towards having a bio with that effect as well!

Listing your age, personality style, and brief hobby descriptions can be helpful to people. But information like this by itself is not that interesting.

Use your profile to showcase your unique style. Crack a joke or two, and give some [recent or important experiences](https://thebeehive.bumble.com/au-blog/bumbleprofileaus) related to what you are talking about. Above all, make sure it’s informative and exciting to read - what’s the news?

### Not Too Active

Still struggling to understand the reason you’re not getting any matches on Bumble? You may be just not using the app enough. Inactive profiles ([those that have gone 30 days since the last log-in](https://techcult.com/does-bumble-show-inactive-profiles/)) are shown less frequently to other accounts.

In fact, an inactive account might not be shown at all. And remember, messages from matches will time out after 24 hours. So make sure you’re actively using the app!

### Incorrect Settings

If you have a specific “type” when dating, you might be setting your preference ranges too narrowly. Over-limiting the distance filter, age filter, or any other filter options can diminish your pool of potential matches.

Think about widening your age range, distance, and other options. These changes will ensure you have the best chance of matching with the right person!

### You’re Being Too Specific With Your Swipes

Believe us, we understand not wanting to swipe on Jimmy Greaseball’s profile or Crazy Janet. Some people are out there who you just won’t want to swipe on. But don’t ignore someone just because their pictures were taken in the snow instead of the sun.

Specificity with your swipes is good - don’t just swipe right on everybody. However, don’t be too granular when considering whether to message or move on. If you rule everyone out, no one will be left to match!

## Actionable Tips to Get More Matches on Bumble

So, if those are the problems you might face - how do we get the results that we want? Thanks to our team’s extensive work, we can give you some quick, actionable tips to help increase your matches. It’s time to get those likes and messages flowing instead of sitting there questioning the app’s algorithm.

### Nail Your Profile Picture

Your face is something that everyone will see the first time they meet you. The same goes for dating apps. Making sure your Bumble profile picture is on point means ensuring you have the following:

* Good lighting for your photo
* Someone else to take the photo - selfie sticks are so 2010s!
* A well-cleaned and well-groomed look.

A nice outfit and background are also winning attributes for a great profile picture for men and women alike.

### Remove Your Selfies

Selfies are a quick way to get some serviceable pictures. The quick and easy ones. However, many lists of profile optimization tips recommend that you avoid these.

Why? Well, taking a good selfie is notoriously tricky. They almost always come with an arm, selfie stick, or mirror in the way of the main attraction - you!

It’s also worth considering revising and refreshing your profile photos regularly. Your appearance and style will naturally change over time!

### Use Bumble at the Right Time

Make sure you are using the app at times when large numbers of other people are doing so. Getting on your phone at peak times will likely boost your chances of a match.

While some singles might use the app throughout the day, working guys and gals will be busy throughout the daytime. Instead, use[the app between 6pm and 10pm](https://bumble.com/en/the-buzz/bumbletimes) (depending on your demographic).

Using the app at peak times is much more likely to land you in a large pool of simultaneous users. This deliberate change in usage will enhance the likelihood of finding a match quickly.

### Complete Your Profile

Try experimenting with different photos to support your main profile picture. These photos can be a great way to showcase your personality better and help you appear more interesting.

Adjusting profile settings can be one of the easiest fixes for the issue of not getting any matches.

### Add an Interesting Bio

Use your bio to showcase your personality:

* If you’re a fan of silly jokes, throw one in!
* Talk about your favorite activities in depth - add related anecdotes or key experiences
* Treat it more like a biography than a shopping list.

Make sure you are seeking feedback on profile content as well. While you might think it’s great, your friends will be able to point at parts that could do with improvement.

Browsing through tips and tricks online can also be an excellent way to help optimize your bio for better engagement.

### Be Active and Swipe Often

Bumble’s has a “time out after 24 hours” feature for opening messages. As such, consistently getting matches will be difficult if you only log on once a week. Everyone trying to match with you will have had their offer expire!

Instead, log in reasonably frequently and swipe through the profiles you are presented with regularly. Like any social networking site or app, Bumble values user interaction. The more you interact, the more likely others will interact with you!

### Connect Your Social Media Accounts

You can only fit so much data in a Bumble profile. Sure, you can eventually tell someone more in an online chat or on a date. However, a lot of people want to know more about you sooner.

Connect your social media accounts like Instagram, Spotify, or Facebook. These accounts will help give prospective matches a better idea of your vibe and style.

### Try Bumble Boost or Bumble Premium Services

If you’re still struggling to find joy with Bumble matches, it might be worth contemplating a switch to premium.

[Bumble Boost](https://bumble.com/help/what-is-bumble-boost) helps overcome some common user experience challenges by floating your profile to the top of the queue. Bumble Boost will also give you further tools to show others you’re interested in them. Bumble Premium has various similar features and some extra customization tools.

### Be Flexible With the Filters

Remember, having a specific type or maybe just a general idea of what you want is okay. However, limiting yourself with strict filters won’t increase the number of matches you get. Reevaluating personal preferences can be a great way to increase your number of matches.

If you usually look for people very similar in age, consider expanding your preferred age range! If you’re only looking for someone super close by, try upping the distance options.
