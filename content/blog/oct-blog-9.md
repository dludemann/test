## What Is Tinder?

Tinder is currently the [most popular dating app](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/tinder-users-by-country) in the world! Founded in 2012, the app was an immediate game-changer in the sphere of online dating. Featuring a simple, user-friendly platform, Tinder is a mobile dating app that prioritizes user photos and succinct profiles, instead of lengthy bios.

The app itself is straightforward — users create a profile, including an all-important profile photo, and add some basic information, including likes and interests. Once your profile is complete, Tinder shows you profiles of other users in your preferred area and range. You can swipe right on the profiles if you like what you see or swipe left if you’re not interested.

And if both of you swipe right — it’s a match! Once you match, Tinder opens a private chat window, so you have the chance to strike up a conversation. If you’re lucky, that conversation can lead to a date or even a relationship.

One of the reasons Tinder remains so popular is its simplicity. It lets you meet new people without an extensive profile or lengthy sign-up process. If you’re looking to increase your chances, the app has a variety of features, such as Tinder Boost and Super Likes, which can increase your visibility. It’s a great tool for those looking for something casual, and can even lead to love and potential long-term relationships.

## Can You Send Photos on Tinder?

When you sign up for Tinder, you have the option to upload profile pictures and let’s face it, pictures are incredibly important in online dating. Humans are visual creatures, and we all have our preferences when it comes to looks. But what about if you’re mid-conversation with a match and want to send them a photo?

### How Can I Share a Photo with Someone on Tinder?

As of 2023, Tinder [doesn’t support](https://www.wikihow.com/Send-Pictures-on-Tinder) sending picture messages. Users can only send text and GIFs to communicate with each other. This rule aims to protect users from inappropriate images.

If you’re been wondering “What’s the process to attach a picture in a Tinder message?” we have some bad news — you can’t! Unfortunately, it’s impossible to attach a picture to a Tinder message — Tinder’s platform simply won’t allow it.

The only photos Tinder supports are profile photos, so if you want to do everything by the book, ensure you have a comprehensive range of flattering and attractive profile pictures.

If you feel like your profile pictures need a bit of help, why not try using the services of The Match Artist? They offer professional photography that will get your profile pics looking better than ever. They also have a comprehensive blog full of great dating advice, including how to send photos on [Bumble](https://thematchartist.com/bumble/can-you-send-photos-on-bumble) and [Hinge](https://thematchartist.com/hinge/can-you-send-photos-on-hinge)!

## Why Does Tinder Not Allow Photos Sharing?

Tinder has strict [community guidelines](https://policies.tinder.com/community-guidelines/intl/en/) and prioritizes consent and respect in their interactions. By not allowing photo sharing, they ensure they protect users from unwanted inappropriate images, such as unsolicited nudes. This creates a safer environment and also means Tinder has less moderation to do.

The rule also encourages users to get to know each other through conversation and text instead of just sharing visual content like photos. Limiting image sharing also protects Tinder from liability in case illegal images are shared on the platform. This helps to protect user safety and app integrity.

## Three Simple Workarounds to Share Photos on Tinder

Even though you can’t send photos via Tinder’s messaging platform, that doesn’t mean there aren’t methods to share pictures with your matches. There are a few different strategies to get around the rules and exchange pics.

### Send Photo Links by Uploading Them to a Cloud Storage Website

So, we’ve already determined that the answer to “Can I send photos directly from my camera roll or gallery?” is a big fat ‘No’. But what if you’re wondering, “Can I link to external photos or use third-party hosting services?”. In that case, there are quite a few options!

If you use a cloud storage service like Google Drive, iCloud, or other image hosting services, you can take steps to upload photos and then share links via Tinder. Make sure you ensure that the permissions are set correctly so that your Tinder match is authorized to view the photo. You can then just paste the link into your Tinder chat window and send it!

You can also share links on Tinder for non-photo-related reasons. Sharing thought-provoking articles or blog posts is a great way to deepen your relationship with a match, and move on from surface-level conversation.

#### Can I Retract or Delete a Photo Once It's Been Sent?

Once you send a message via a link on a Tinder chat, it can’t be retracted, so make sure you only send pictures you’re happy to share. You can remove the image from your hosting service, but this doesn’t protect against downloading or screenshots.

#### What Precautions Should I Take When Sharing Personal Photos?

Always abide by Tinder’s community guidelines, and also use common sense. Don’t upload anything you wouldn’t be happy ending up on a public forum.

#### Are Photos Shared on Tinder Encrypted for Added Security?

Tinder has overall [security measures](https://policies.tinder.com/security/intl/en/) for data protection, but there is nothing specific in place to protect photos shared via cloud storage links. Make sure you never upload a picture that could compromise your privacy.

### Upload Pictures to Your Tinder Profile

If there’s a particular picture you want to show your match, you can always upload it to your Tinder profile. You can add new pictures at any time, just go to your profile and click on the ‘Add Photos’ section. You can then choose images from your photo library, photo gallery, or Instagram account.

Once the photo is uploaded, let the person you’re chatting with know that the picture is there and they can go and look at it. If your profile pictures in general seem like they need a little something, try engaging the services of The Match Artist. They use body language and facial expression coaching to ensure you look your absolute best, and are the ideal way to [get more matches on Tinder](https://thematchartist.com/tinder/how-to-get-more-matches-on-tinder)!

#### How Does Tinder Handle Inappropriate or Offensive Photos?

Remember to keep all profile pictures within Tinder’s guidelines. Tinder is very strict when it comes to offensive or inappropriate photos, and breaking the rules can result in a permanent ban. Tinder users a combination of in-person moderation and automated algorithms to find inappropriate material and report it.

#### What Are the Privacy Settings for Shared Photos on Tinder?

If you share a photo by uploading it to your profile, you don’t get to control who sees it. Everything on your profile is public to other Tinder users, so ensure you only upload pictures you’d be happy with everyone seeing.

#### Are There Any Size or Format Limitations for Photos on Tinder?

The [ideal photo size](https://limanibhavik.medium.com/popular-social-media-profile-and-cover-picture-sizes-577e01aee831) for a Tinder picture is 640 x 640 px. Tinder accepts pictures in JPG and PNG format, as well as non-animated GIFs.

#### How Does Tinder’s Photo Verification Feature Work?

Tinder’s [photo verification feature](https://www.help.tinder.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034941812-Photo-Verification) lets you show matches that you really do look like your pictures. You need to submit a video selfie that will then be compared to your pictures using facial recognition technology.

### Connect on a Different Social Media App

Another great way to share pictures with your matches is to move the whole conversation away from Tinder. You can use a different social media app, such as Instagram or Snapchat, which allows you to share pictures and memes.

Make sure you only do this with someone you’ve been chatting with for a while and that you feel confident with, as moving the conversation away from Tinder means you are more at risk of inappropriate interactions. If you feel really confident, you can also share your phone number and move straight to the texting point!

#### How Can I Report Someone Who Sends Unsolicited or Inappropriate Pictures?

If you receive inappropriate pictures sent to you via Tinder chat through an external URL, you can [report](https://www.help.tinder.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003359426-Reporting-someone-on-Tinder#:~:text=If%20you%20encounter%20someone%20who's,more%20respectful%20community%20for%20everyone.) the user directly to Tinder using the report function. Tinder reporting only relates to something that happens on the app, so make sure you think carefully before moving your chat to another platform.

#### What Precautions Should I Take When Sharing Personal Photos?

Thankfully on Tinder, you won’t have to wonder “How long does a sent photo remain viewable in the chat?, but when sharing personal photos, regardless of the platform, make sure you consider the following precautions:

* Only share images you are comfortable with a wider audience seeing
* Make sure your photos don’t reveal personal information
* Be vigilant of phishing scams or other attempts to steal your information through photo sharing.

### Send Bitmojis or GIFs
