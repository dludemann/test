Relationships can be hard for anyone, and that goes double for adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). They find it especially hard because of the challenges that ASD causes. But, that doesn’t mean that they cannot find partners who will go the extra mile for them, whether [through dating sites](https://thematchartist.com/blog/autism-dating-sites) or offline.

The most important thing when [dating someone on the spectrum](https://thematchartist.com/blog/autism-dating) is to be patient and ready to tackle anything that may arise, like social anxiety, the need for solitude, difficulties with communication, etc.

In this article we’ll learn:

* What challenges does autism cause in adult relationships
* Ways to navigate these challenges
* Answers to some frequently asked questions

Then, let’s begin!

## **What is Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)?**

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain. People with ASD may behave, communicate, interact, and learn in ways that are different from most other people. Per CDC, ASD begins before the age of 3 years and can last throughout a person's life, although symptoms may improve over time.

Common characteristics and symptoms of ASD include:

* difficulties with social interactions
* challenges in understanding and interpreting social cues
* communication difficulties
* restricted/repetitive behaviors and routines
* sensory sensitivities
* need for predictability and consistency

## **Challenges of Autism in Adult Relationships**

Adults with ASD may face challenges in their relationships that other neurotypical people don’t. These challenges can impact their ability to connect, communicate, and interact with their partners.

### **Their Need for Solitude is Real**

Many autistic individuals require periods of alone time for recovery and to reduce sensory overload. This need for solitude is not a rejection of their partner or loved ones but an important aspect of their well-being.

Here’s how you can support their need for solitude:

* create a quiet space for them to retreat to
* establish clear boundaries and signals for alone time
* encourage regular breaks during social activities
* avoid interrupting them while they are recovering

### **Struggling with Social Cues**

People on the spectrum often have difficulties with non-verbal cues such as body language and facial expressions. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications in relationships.

There are some strategies to navigate these challenges:

1. practice clear and direct communication
2. use literal language to express emotions and needs
3. be patient and gently provide feedback when misunderstandings happen

### **Difficulty Maintaining Eye Contact**

Eye contact can be difficult for a lot of autistic people, or even downright uncomfortable. They tend to avoid it and appear confused and anxious when it occurs. This can sometimes be misinterpreted as disinterest or dishonesty.

Here are some alternative ways for emotional connection:

* focus on some other body part instead of direct eye contact
* use physical touch, such as holding hands or a gentle touch on the arm
* communicate feelings through written notes or messages

### **Desire for Consistency**

Routine and predictability are important for many individuals with ASD because it helps them feel secure. Creating and establishing routines can provide structure and a genuine sense of stability with the knowledge of what will happen next.

Suggestions for maintaining consistency:

* establish regular routines and schedules
* create checklists
* communicate any changes well in advance
* keep important items in consistent locations

### **Sensory Challenges**

People with autism can experience over and under-sensitivity to a lot of different stimuli. These sensitivities can cause discomfort, making certain environments or activities challenging. Stimuli are: sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touch, etc.
