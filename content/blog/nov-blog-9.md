## What is Coffee Meets Bagel?

Coffee Meets Bagel (CMB for short) is a dating app that aims to help serious daters find meaningful connections. Unlike other dating platforms such as Tinder, the app is focused on quality over quantity and relationships over hookups.

The app was [founded](https://coffeemeetsbagel.com/AboutUs) by three sisters in 2012 after they became tired of online dating. It’s a refreshing change from other dating apps - a place where people looking for genuine relationships can be intentional about their dating.

### How Does Coffee Meets Bagel Work?

[Coffee Meets Bagel prioritizes](https://thematchartist.com/coffee-meets-bagel/how-does-coffee-meets-bagel-work) a smaller, more curated community - it’s all about quality over quantity. Once a day you receive several matches (called ‘bagels’ on the app). You can then decide whether to pass on these matches or start a conversation with them.

CMB helps you start the chat by providing icebreakers and prompts to initiate conversation. This helps users discover common interests and share personal stories without awkwardness.

Coffee Meets Bagel also encourages users to create [detailed profiles](https://thematchartist.com/coffee-meets-bagel/profile-examples) in order to help them find the perfect match. That way you won’t find yourself conversing with anyone whose values don’t align with yours!

## What are Icebreakers on Coffee Meets Bagel?

When you match with a Bagel and start chatting with your match, CMB (Coffee Meets Bagel) provides you with an [icebreaker](https://coffeemeetsbagel.medium.com/5-tips-to-take-your-chats-to-the-next-level-1009995d5a09#:~:text=Time%20to%20Get%20Chatty&amp;text=Every%20time%20you%20match%20with,in%20the%20bottom%20right%20corner.) to help start the conversation. When you fill out your dating profile, there’s a section that you can fill out to help CMB create icebreakers.

Or, if you don’t like CMB’s suggestions, you can start with an icebreaker of your own! An icebreaker is just a conversation starter- designed to ease the awkwardness and help see if you match interests. Instead of a boring conversation where you engage in small talk, you can inquire about hobbies, share personal stories, or entertain with anecdotes.

## What are the Benefits of Icebreakers on Coffee Meets Bagel?

Using icebreakers on CMB is a great way to take the stress out of starting a conversation. You’ll find it easier to initiate conversations, and may also find you end up having deeper and more meaningful discussions with your matches.

### Initiating Conversations More Easily

Icebreakers mean starting a conversation is easier - no more beginning your chat with “hey” or “what’s up”! They give you both something to start talking about, meaning you can have a more relaxed and enjoyable chat.

### Creating a Comfortable Interaction Space

Icebreakers create a comfortable interaction space, which means it’s easier to move on to more in-depth conversation topics. This approach is the ideal way to encourage open dialogue and you can even flirt subtly - once the ice is broken, you’ll find that the conversation flows!

### Showcasing Your Personality and Humor

Witty or weird icebreakers are a great way to showcase your personality. Impress with humor, amuse with jokes, or entertain with anecdotes - it’s up to you!

### Breaking Down Awkwardness

We get it - online dating can be awkward! Icebreakers can help with that, providing an easy way to transition from breaking the ice to more meaningful conversations. They remove uncertainty from the initial interaction, meaning both of you feel more confident.

### Finding Common Interests

In our experience, tying your icebreaker to your hobbies, interests or opinions is a great way to get the conversation flowing. It’s the perfect method to discover common interests and inquire about hobbies.

## How to Make the First Move on Coffee Meets Bagel

While making the first move might sound daunting, it doesn’t need to be! With the right strategies and icebreakers, you can start a great conversation that can even lead to a lasting relationship!

### Questions to Get to Know Someone Better

Asking open-ended questions is a great strategy to help get to know someone better. Make sure you're questions encourage answers that reveal who the person is, their personality, life goals, and interests - this is perfect for creating a foundation for connection.

### Activity Reports

Coffee Meets Bagel provides [activity reports](https://coffeemeetsbagel.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021076213-What-is-included-in-the-Activity-Reports), which are a summary of a dater’s most recent connections. From this information, you can see how often they send the first message and how long it takes them to respond to a message, and use this to inform your approach. For example, if you match with someone who never sends the first message and rarely replies, you may decide to spend your energy elsewhere.

### Photo Lab

The CMB Photo Lab lets guys and girls vote on photos and can provide a basis for initiating a conversation. There is [some controversy](https://medium.com/@mraybman/featurefail-coffee-meets-bagel-photo-lab-2f78db949779)over how effective CMB’s photo lab actually is, though; results suggest that the highest-rated photo may always be the one closest to the voter’s thumb!

If you truly want to ensure you have the best possible picture, we recommend using the professional photographers at The Match Artist - their facial expression coaching will have your pictures looking better than ever.

### Conversation Starters

[CMB recommends](https://coffeemeetsbagel.medium.com/5-tips-to-take-your-chats-to-the-next-level-1009995d5a09#:~:text=Start%20your%20chat%20off%20with,is%2C%20and%20share%20yours%20too.) starting conversations with questions that you truly want to hear the answer to. If you’re interested in what your match has to say, the conversation is likely to flow a lot more easily!

### Personality Questions

Make sure you answer as many CMB prompts on your profile as a way to highlight your personality traits - these can also be used as conversation starters. Ask your match about their preferences and personality type, such as whether they’re an introvert or extrovert. It’ll give you a better idea of what they’re like and if you’ll be compatible.

## Popular Icebreaker Examples on Coffee Meets Bagel

The point of icebreakers is to make starting a conversation easy, fun, and enjoyable. Here are some of our favorite examples of icebreakers, but remember, not all icebreakers will work for every person! Only use ones that you feel comfortable using - it’s all about being authentic.

You can think of the first conversation on CMB almost as a virtual date - the only difference is you can’t actually see the other person! You can chat, get to know them and even place an icebreaker game to get to know them.

### Fun and Quirky Questions

Fun and silly questions bring playfulness to the conversation. Ask things like “What superpower would you choose?” or “If you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?”. They’re a great way to break the ice and create a lighthearted atmosphere.

### Personal Experience Sharing

Ask the other person to share personal stories, such as “What's the best vacation you’ve ever been on?”. This helps to discover common interests and deepen the connection between the two of you.

### Light-Hearted Debates

Make sure you keep things light - this isn’t the time for heavy political debates! Try asking a lighthearted yet controversial question like “Does pineapple belong on pizza?” and go from there.

### "Would You Rather" Scenarios

These are always a fun way to get the conversation flowing - just make sure you keep them silly, not gross! You can get insight into the other person’s personality and instantly get comfortable with them.

### Unique Trivia and Facts

This one can be tricky - make sure you’re not info dumping about your interests on the other person! On the other hand, well-chosen intriguing facts can be a good way to attract attention, reveal unique traits, and spark a conversation.

### Creative Hypothetical Situations

Similar to ‘would you rather’ scenarios, these are a fun way to get the conversation flowing. One of our favorites is “If you could live in any fictional universe, what would it be?”, but the possibilities truly are endless!

### Open-Ended Life Queries

If you’re feeling a little more serious, open-ended life queries are a good way to get to know someone. “What does your perfect day look like?” or “What do you hope your life looks like at age 50” are good options. Choose your words carefully, and make sure you don’t get *too* serious!

## Tips for the Best First Text on Coffee Meets Bagel

Making that first text count is important - first impressions truly do matter. Here are some of our top tips:

### Keep It Short and Sweet

No one likes long, rambling first messages. Keep it short, snappy, and easy to respond to.

### Be Confident

Confidence is appealing - there’s nothing worse than a self-deprecating first text. Confidence also shows you’re genuinely interested in getting to know your match better, and will help them feel more comfortable in the conversation.

### Tell a Joke

Break the ice by including humor in your messaging. It’s perfect for sparking a connection and showcasing your fun personality.

### Give Them a Compliment

This one is tricky - you don’t want to come across as creepy, but a good compliment can make someone’s day. Make sure you compliment genuinely and that the compliment is linked to something you’ve seen on their profile - it’ll show them you’ve paid attention and put in the effort!

### Ask Open-Ended Questions

Avoid questions with yes or no answers and ask open-ended questions that foster conversation. Show an interest in their life, hobbies, and interests - it can keep the conversation going and help you figure out if you’d be a good match.

### Who makes the first move on CMB?

Unlike other dating sites like Bumble, where only the woman can send the first message, either user can make the first move once matched. This makes CMB a balanced platform where men and women are equally able to express interest and make connections.
