## What is Coffee Meets Bagel?

Coffee Meets Bagel (CMB) is a dating app that focuses on [making quality matches and having meaningful conversations](https://www.forbes.com/health/dating/coffee-meets-bagel-review/), instead of just hookups. It aims to reduce ‘swiping fatigue’ by providing people with a curated number of ‘bagels’ (potential matches) every day at midday. This means fewer matches to choose from, leading to a more thoughtful and deliberate dating experience.

### How Does the Platform Work?

CMB [works](https://thematchartist.com/coffee-meets-bagel/how-does-coffee-meets-bagel-work) by taking into account user preferences, likes, interests, and activity on the app to suggest matches.

Every day, men receive a curated list of profiles of women (or vice versa) who have expressed an interest in them, creating a match. Users can then engage with each other via prompts and icebreakers.

This way, CMB helps users make deep connections and prevents users from feeling overwhelmed by the number of potential matches.

## What are Coffee Meets Bagel Prompts?

CMB prompts are a way to [break the ice](https://coffeemeetsbagel.medium.com/5-tips-to-give-your-profile-the-new-year-refresh-it-deserves-f80cf55c4681) and share some information about yourself with potential dates. They are conversation starters that allow users to showcase their personality, interests, hobbies, and preferences, making a more engaging dating profile and giving context to photos and bio details.

Prompts allow sharing of personal interests and experiences and enable users to describe aspects of their lives. They’re also a great way to reveal insights into users' preferences and values and illustrate users' sense of humor or viewpoints.

### The Purpose of Prompts in Enhancing User Profiles

It’s easy to get disillusioned with online dating when you just see the same thing in everyone’s profile. Prompts can enhance user profiles and add depth. They let users showcase their unique selves and share their lifestyles, preferences, and values.

It’s a great chance to provide creative answers that will spark engaged messaging and find meaningful connections. Those who don’t bother to fill out the prompts may find they get fewer matches, or even [no matches at all](https://thematchartist.com/coffee-meets-bagel/no-matches-on-coffee-meets-bagel), as this shows a lack of care and effort.

### How Prompts Differ from Other Profile Sections

The prompts encourage users to dig a little deeper, compared to the standard sections like age, location, and photos. Users can share experiences, thoughts, and opinions, expressing their individuality and uniqueness.

## Examples of Coffee Meets Bagel Prompts

CMB prompts are designed to create an engaging profile and reveal meaningful details about a user’s personality. Creativity and authenticity is key - let’s take a closer look at some examples.

### CMB Profile Example Prompt: "I am..."

This prompt lets users summarize themselves in a few words. Highlight the things about yourself that are most important to you. For example “I am an optimist who finds the fun in every situation”. It’s a great chance to engage potential matches in meaningful conversations by sharing what’s important to you.

### CMB Profile Example Prompt: "I Like..."

Here you can share your preferences and likes in a simple manner. Whether it’s music, games, hiking, or something else, use this prompt to paint a picture of what brings you joy.

This prompt is perfect for communicating lifestyle choices and hobbies and highlighting key aspects of users' personalities, as well as displaying a range of interests and passions.

### CMB Profile Example Prompt: "I Appreciate When My Date..."

This is the best place to share your dating preferences and the qualities or actions you value in your date. Share the kinds of behavior or personality traits you are looking for in a significant other to help find someone who shares your values.

### CMB Profile Example Prompt: "My Ideal Date..."

In our experience, it’s great to get creative with this prompt! Describe your ideal dating experience, making sure you’re authentic to your actual experiences. You don’t want to claim your ideal date is doing extreme sports when you’d prefer a coffee and bookshop date, for example!

## How to Write Effective CMB Prompts To Get Instant Matches

Crafting effective prompts can hugely increase your chances of making connections on the app. The best prompts invite users to answer engaging questions and encourage responses that reflect personality traits. This lets you get to know matches on a deeper level. Some of our tips for creating the best prompt responses include:

### Choose the Right Prompts

Choosing prompts that align with users’ comfort zones and interests is key. Choose questions that let users express individuality and uniqueness in profiles, and that let you articulate thoughts and ideas more clearly.

### Be Authentic and Honest

Being authentic and honest in your answers fosters transparency. Give matches a opportunity to get to know the real you and assess compatibility by answering honestly. Authenticity is more likely to spark meaningful connections and messages.

### Showcase Your Unique Personality

Prompts are a great way to highlight key aspects of your personality. These details help illustrate users’ sense of humor or viewpoints, making your profile more memorable.

### Use Humor Effectively

Did you know that humor is one of the [most effective](https://www.psychologytoday.com/nz/blog/love-digitally/201502/be-more-successful-in-online-dating-use-humour) online dating tactics? Entertain potential matches with witty or humorous responses. Show them you’re not only interesting but fun to date! It’s one of the best creative options to express personality while online dating.

### Keep Responses Concise and Engaging

While it’s great to share information about yourself, you’re not writing a novel! Keep your responses short and sweet while still including responses that reflect personality traits and invite users to answer engaging questions.

## Advantages of Coffee Meets Bagel Prompts

Coffee Meets Bagel advertises itself as being for ‘serious daters, and the prompts are a great way to show potential matches how serious you are about finding a match.

### Quality Matches

The prompts offer a chance to give users a deeper glimpse into your personality, interests and dating goals. This lets the algorithm find you compatible matches that can lead to long term partners.

### Activity Reports & Relationship Goals

CMB gives users activity reports on matches, which gives insights into how users are engaging with the app. This helps you find a match that shares your lifestyle and preferences.

### Enhancing Profile Engagement

Prompts serve as an engaging way to invite users to answer engaging questions, which improves profile engagement. They also help your profile stand out in a sea of profiles.

### Showcasing Personality and Interests

Prompts let users express their individuality and uniqueness. Prompts are an excellent way to connect users based on shared interests or beliefs and inform others about personal likes and dislikes.

### Facilitating Meaningful Conversations

The prompts move your profile beyond basic bio information and help facilitate meaningful conversations. It’s a way to emphasize important traits or qualities in a partner and elaborate on topics to foster deeper connections.

## Setting Up a CMB Profile

So, how do you actually set up a CMB account? It’s designed to be simple and easy - you can either do it with a facebook account or with your phone number.

### Creating an Account & Profile Prompts

Once your profile is created, you can then fill out your profile and add your preferences as well as answer profile prompts.
