## What Makes Good Hinge Pictures for the Best First Impression?

Creating the perfect Hinge profile means choosing a photo to make the best first impression. But what makes a [dating profile photo](https://thematchartist.com/blog/dating-app-pictures) pop or *flop*? While there is some room for personal taste, there are some basics that should be considered before choosing your next pic:

* **Show your personality:** Authenticity is super important on online dating apps. Your photos are a great chance to show what makes you *you.* Include photos that show you engaging in your favorite hobby or activity.
* **Focus on quality:** [Hinge requires all users to have six profile pictures](https://hingeapp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011053094-How-do-I-edit-my-profile), and you should make each one count! Ensure you have a good variety. Include close-ups where your face is visible, along with full-body shots and action shots.
* **Make eye contact:** Your facial expressions and body language are essential! Make eye contact with the camera and ensure your stance is relaxed and confident.
* **Include a headshot:** Include at least one clear shot of your face. Take off those sunglasses and that hat!

## Fundamentals of a Winning Hinge Profile Picture

Knowing the basics makes things easier. The more familiar you are with [taking a great profile picture](https://thematchartist.com/dating-profile-pictures-for-guys-mastering-the-dp-game), the better chances you’ll have. In particular, there are a few key steps to attracting matches, singles, and more swipes:

* **Focus on clarity**: A high-resolution photo with good lighting is essential. Blurriness or bad lighting detract from your appearance and don’t show the real you!
* **Add personality**: Make sure you include pictures that show your authentic self. Use pictures that showcase your hobbies and interests. Pictures featuring your dog or cat are perfect!
* **Choose your outfit**: Formal attire isn’t necessary. Yet, a well-curated outfit will make you feel more confident. As with most things in life, confidence is key!
* **Consider the background**: A messy background is not a good look! Outdoor locations with natural light are usually best. If you take a picture indoors, ensure the lighting is good, and the background is simple and not distracting.
* **Keep group shots minimal**: It’s universally agreed that [no one likes too many group shots on online dating](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/male-tinder-pictures-tips#:~:text=Avoid%20group%20shots,of%20creative%20at%20Hey%20Saturday.). It’s hard for other users to tell which person is you! If you must include a group shot, ensure you have plenty of solo shots to accompany it.

Try sticking to these basics. They’re easy to follow and will help your Hinge Profile stand out!

## How Do Guys Take Good Profile Pictures for Hinge?

So you know what makes for a good dating app profile photo. But how do you get that perfect snap?

Taking the perfect profile picture can seem daunting. This is especially the case if you don’t have any photography experience! Luckily for you, we have a few sure-fire ways to secure the perfect profile picture:

&nbsp;

* **Natural light**: [Natural light](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dos-donts-choosing-stand-out-dating-profile-photos-saskia-nelson/) is an amateur photographer’s best friend! Based on our experience, the' golden hour' is the best time of day to take photos. That is one hour after sunrise or one hour before sunset.
* **Vary your photos**: Besides a close-up shot of your face (preferably with a smile!), ensure you include full-body shots. You can also include some photos of you engaging in hobbies or interests. Remember, the [Tinder Smart Photos feature](https://thematchartist.com/tinder/tinder-smart-photos/) will order your photos for the best results.
* **Use a good quality camera**: If your smartphone doesn’t have a good camera, try borrowing one from a friend. A good camera will make a big difference in picture quality. Quality pictures get quality matches.
* **Seek professional help**: If you’re struggling to get the pictures you want, try using a professional photographer from The Match Artist to make your photos look sharp. They’ll help you convey a sense of confidence and approachability and attract potential matches' attention.

## Selecting the Right Pictures to Put on Hinge

So, you’ve taken a whole lot of prospective dating profile photos. Here’s the exciting part! It’s time to choose which six to include on your Hinge.

Remember, you want to showcase your personality, stay authentic, and make a good impression. There is a lot to remember at once, we know. But try our handy, simple strategies, and you’ll be good to go:

* **Maintain variety**: ** ** Check your photos and make sure you have variety. If you have one picture of a particular outfit, try to pick other images of you dressed differently. If you’ve already got a headshot, include full-body shots.
* **Try some** [photo prompts](https://hingeapp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040576594-What-are-Photo-Prompts): Hinge lets you use photos as conversation starters. While these are optional, they’re a great way to start a conversation about something you’re passionate about. This can work particularly well if you include a photo featuring one of your interests or hobbies.
* **Show off your physique**: We’re not advocating sweaty gym selfies. However, make sure you include at least one full-length picture of yourself. Be proud, and don’t be afraid to show the world what you offer!
* **Demonstrate your lifestyle**: ** ** Your pictures should ideally give a glimpse into what it would be like to date you. If you love hiking or running, include pictures of yourself engaging in these activities. Moreover, if you have pets, feature them—you don’t want to be matched with someone who can’t stand animals!

## Avoiding Common Mistakes in Hinge Photography

Okay, we’ve gone over what to do. But what about what *not* to do?

Everyone should avoid a few big no-nos when taking online dating photographs. Let’s break them down:

* **Photos with an ex**: ** ** You’d think this would be a no-brainer, but no! Many guys still post pictures on their dating profiles, including their exes. Even if you look perfect in that picture with your ex, give it a miss!
* **Too many group photos**: We’ve said it before, but [**group shots are confusing!**](https://www.ajc.com/pulse/5-photos-you-should-not-post-in-your-online-dating-profile/WZBQNJYJKBF7BMN467UH2YGHCA/) We know you want to show that you have friends, but ensure most of your pictures are solo shots. That way, potential matches can tell which one you are.
* **Too many selfies**: ** ** Selfies, and particularly mirror selfies, should be kept to a minimum. Too many can make you look vain, and bathroom mirror selfies can look outdated and immature.
* **Heavily filtered or misleading pictures**: ** ** Everyone wants to look their best, but it’s not a good idea to include misleading pictures. If you’re a bigger guy, don’t use crazy angles to look slimmer. Your match may eventually see you in real life, and you don’t want an awkward first encounter.
* **Blurry or low-resolution photos**: ** ** Natural lighting and high-quality images are crucial. Blurry photos look like you aren’t trying or don’t care - not attractive qualities in a potential match.
* **Overly serious images**: ** ** Include some photos with a genuine smile. Too many serious pictures make you look unapproachable. A smile can get you [**more matches!**](https://bestlifeonline.com/more-matches/)
