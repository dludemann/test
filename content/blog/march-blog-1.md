Did you ever wonder how is it dating someone on the autism spectrum? Maybe there is a cute boy who always makes you laugh, or a beautiful girl you just met on a [dating site](https://thematchartist.com/blog/autism-dating-sites) who made your heart skip a beat, but you are unsure how to properly pursue them without doing something wrong. You want to show them your love, but at the same time, you are afraid to hurt them.

To make this relationship work, the first thing you need to do is to learn more about ASD, and we are here to help with that. In this guide, we’ll explore:

* What is autism
* Dating someone with autism
* 8 things you need to know when dating an autistic person
* Pros and cons of dating a person with autism
* Tips for dating someone with autism

So, let’s begin.

## **What is Autism?**

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain. People with ASD may behave, communicate, interact, and learn in ways that are different from most other people. Per CDC, ASD begins before the age of 3 years and can last throughout a person's life, although symptoms may improve over time.

It's very important to recognize that autism is a spectrum, which means that individuals can experience a wide range of symptoms and severity.

Common Misconceptions about Autism:

* People with autism are cold and lack empathetic feelings.
* Autism only affects children.
* Individuals with autism do not feel love
* People with autism can’t stand to be touched
* All autistic individuals have exceptional talents or savant abilities.

## **Is It Hard Dating an Autistic Person?**

Dating someone on the spectrum can be challenging. These challenges include difficulties with communication, sensory sensitivities, and social interactions. However, with patience, one can approach these problems methodically, consider different perspectives, and avoid rushed decisions.

On the other hand, open communication ensures that all parties involved are on the same page, which in turn can help solve all misunderstandings.

Challenges that can occur:

* Difficulty with social cues and nonverbal communication.
* Sensory sensitivities that lead to discomfort in certain environments.
* Differences in emotional expression and understanding.
* People with autism often have routines, which require their partners to be flexible and understanding

## **8 Things You Need to Know When Dating Individuals on the Spectrum**

Dating someone on the autism spectrum can be rewarding, but it requires both understanding and patience. Familiarizing yourself with your partner’s unique characteristics and needs can help you build a stronger, more loving connection. Here are 8 essential things to know to build a healthy and supportive relationship.

### **They are not Emotionless:**

While commonly believed, this isn’t true. People with autism are still people and can feel emotions, sometimes even more than others, experts say. However, they may express it in ways that are harder to recognize.

That’s why one needs to pay close attention to their unique ways of communicating. Look for non-verbal cues, such as changes in body language or repetitive behaviors.

Here are some examples of how they can express emotions:

* Their facial expressions may not align with their actual feelings
* Use very literal language or have delayed responses when expressing their emotions
* Overreaction or underreaction to sensory stimuli (covering ears when anxious)

### **Some Love Touch, Some Don't:**

People on the spectrum may be over-sensitive or under-sensitive to specific sights, sounds, smells, or textures. The same goes for physical contact and while this can be a positive thing, it can also cause distress or discomfort.

That’s why it’s important to know how to navigate these challenges, so here are some tips:

* Be respectful and communicate openly about boundaries
* Always approach them from the front
* Warn the person if you are about to touch them
* Keep in mind that a hug may be painful rather than comforting

### **They Cannot Be Diplomatic:**

Individuals with autism may have difficulties understanding unwritten social rules or expressing themselves in a way that is perceived as socially appropriate. This can result in them being very blunt and honest without considering others’ feelings.

Here are some situations that can happen and advice on how to handle them:

1. If they are being overly blunt, gently explain to them that there are other ways they can say something to someone
2. If they misunderstand social cues and react inappropriately, what you can do is try to teach them not to make the same mistake, or encourage them to ask someone what would be the appropriate response

### **Your Actions May Not Be Understandable:**

Autistic individuals often experience challenges in interpreting social cues, which can lead to misunderstandings in social interactions. For example, they might take a sarcastic remark literally or miss the subtle indications of discomfort in someone else's body language.

Common misunderstandings that can occur:

* touching someone without realizing it might be uncomfortable
* wrongly interpreting someone’s facial expression
* not noticing when someone wants to end a conversation

### **They Do Not Mind Your Questions:**

While you may think it’s insensitive to ask questions, you shouldn’t refrain from doing so. People on the spectrum won’t mind them. In fact, they’ll value you trying to be open and communicate with them.

You can ask these questions to understand their perspective better:

* “Is it hard for you to make eye contact?”
* “How do you think we can address this issue together?”
* “What does sensory overload feel like?”

### **Large Crowds Might Make Them Uncomfortable:**

Many individuals with autism find large crowds and noisy environments overwhelming due to their sensory sensitivities. This can lead to anxiety and discomfort. That’s why you should opt for quieter, more intimate dates like:

* picnic
* vineyard tour
* stargazing

### **They May Not Understand Sarcasm:**

Because people on the spectrum tend to take words at face value, it can be troubling for them to understand sarcasm. To avoid confusion, it's best to be straightforward and communicate in literal terms.

* avoid open-ended questions
* avoid using irony, figurative language, idioms, etc.
* use less non-verbal communication

### **Eye Contact May Be Difficult at Times:**

Some common reasons why people with autism find it hard to maintain eye contact are due to sensory sensitivity, such as sensory overload, and social anxiety. They might struggle to focus on the person they are talking to because they find it too much or they might find eye contact difficult in social situations.

Here are some tips for understanding and respecting personal comfort levels:

* Recognize sensory overload
* Use subtle visual cues
* Create a comfortable environment
