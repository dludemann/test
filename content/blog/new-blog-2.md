Ready to jump in? Let’s get started!

## What Is Tinder?

Tinder is a popular online dating app that was started in 2012 in Hollywood, California by Sean Rad and Joe Munoz. Initially known as “MatchBox”, it was renamed Tinder due to its similarity to Match.com.

Only two years after the app was unveiled, they were registering [a billion Swipes per day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinder_&#40;app&#41;). [As of 2023](https://earthweb.com/tinder-statistics), there are 75 million people worldwide using Tinder every month, or which 7.8 million are in the U.S.

The popularity of Tinder has led to a number of other dating apps, including Hinge and Bumble.

Tinder is designed to be used on your touch device (so that you can swipe on your screen to browse profiles), though you can also log-in on the desktop website from either your PC or Mac. However, you won’t be able to Swipe on members’ profiles on the desktop version — you can only click — which could lead to a less intuitive experience.

Tinder is a location-based app, meaning that you can match with others in a set area or radius. You can adjust this radius in your settings.

Users navigate Tinder, generally, by either Liking profiles (Swiping Right) or passing on profiles (Swiping Left). On the basic version of Tinder, you won’t know if someone has Swiped Right on you, unless you also Swipe Right on them, or they use the Super Like feature.

Once users match, they’re placed in a private chat room where they have the ability to begin a conversation, learn more about each other, and hopefully make a love match!

You can download the app from the App Store for Apple devices, or the Google Play store for Android devices.

Icons and symbols you may see while using Tinder include:

* The green heart (Like)
* The blue star (Super Like)
* The purple lightning bolt (Boost)
* The red X (Pass)
* The yellow rewind (Rewind)
* The Tinder Gold heart (Tinder Gold Like)
* The Tinder Gold diamond (Tinder Gold Top Pick)
* The blue shield (report or unmatch)
* The blue checkmark (verified profile)
* The red dot (new notifications)

You’ll see most of these when you’re in the Discovery screen, but you may also see them in other places in your Tinder feed, eg, the Likes You feed.

## Unveiling the Tinder Gold Heart

If you have a Tinder Gold or Tinder Platinum subscription, you’ll be able to both use and receive gold hearts, and see them in your Likes You feed. If you have only upgraded to Tinder Plus, you’ll be unable to use this feature.

Bear in mind that this feature is only available to users who have upgraded as Gold or Platinum subscribers, and you won’t be able to purchase it separately.

### What Does the Gold Heart Mean on Tinder?

If you see a gold heart on someone’s profile in your match queue, this means that the user has Liked you and they have Tinder Gold.

If you return the Like, you’ll match with the user and be placed in a private chat room, where you can begin to chat, make a connection, and hopefully go on an IRL date!

### The Significance of Yellow/Gold Hearts on Tinder

The gold (or yellow) hearts feature is actually very similar to Super Likes — the blue star icon — in that it guarantees a match if you Swipe Right on them.

However, unlike Super Likes, which all users have access to, only Premium Subscribers can send gold hearts to each other.

*But what significance does that have?*

Well, users who have upgraded their account to a premium subscription are more likely to be serious about their <a href="https://thematchartist.com/tinder/how-to-use-tinder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use of the app</a>, dating in general, and may be looking more seriously for relationships and love.

If that’s also your situation, then you can be sure that the person on the other end has a real commitment in *wanting to match with you!*

If you decide to Swipe Right on them and begin sending messages to each other, be sure to be clear about your intentions and boundaries up front. That way you’ll both know if it’s a love match, or if you’re wasting each other’s time!

### Why Do Yellow Hearts Appear on Tinder?

If you see a yellow (or gold) heart on your Tinder, this shows you that the singles who have Liked you are not only extremely interested in you, they’re also a premium member of the app.

### Can Other People See Tinder Gold Hearts?

General users will not be able to see gold hearts, unless they have paid for Tinder Gold or Tinder Platinum. Even then, they will only see the gold hearts that they receive or distribute.

## Exploring Tinder Gold Heart Variations

A simple gold heart isn’t the only variation that you may see on Tinder. Here’s a few other versions of Tinder icons you may notice on your page.

### What Does the Gold Heart with Three Lines Mean on Tinder?

The gold heart with three lines is simply the Like logo for Tinder Gold users. If you see it next to a person’s name, that will indicate that they’re either a Tinder Gold user and that they have Liked your profile to indicate their interest.

### Tinder Gold Heart vs. Tinder Black Heart

If you see a black heart symbol, it has much the same functionality as a gold heart, except that it indicates that the user has a Tinder Platinum subscription. You’ll only be able to see these if you also have a Platinum subscription.

## Understanding Tinder Gold

Before you jump in and make the decision to purchase the Tinder Gold service, you should know what you’re getting yourself into. While there are many benefits to upgrading your app, it doesn’t guarantee the chance that you’ll meet the love of your life (*or of the moment!*).

### How Much is Tinder Gold?

The price of Tinder Gold may vary, depending on where in the world you are, how old you are, and whether or not Tinder has changed its pricing structure recently (which it does a lot).

Currently, a Tinder Gold subscription could cost you roughly $22.49 per month.

### Is Getting Tinder Gold Worth It?

It’s hard to say definitively if Tinder Gold is worth it, as it’ll depend on your personal circumstances and reasons for upgrading. However, it *could* help you match more with others on the app, as it has some pretty decent extra features.

These include:

* Unlimited Likes
* Access to five free Super Likes per week
* Unlimited Rewinds
* Access to the Likes You feed
* Access to Tinder Boosts (one free Boost per month)
* Ability to hide ads
* Ability to use Tinder Passport
* An increased number of Top Picks available
* Ability to control aspects of your profile, including who can see you and who you can see.

However, despite the above list, bear in mind that you could pay all the money in the world and still not receive any matches, if your general profile isn’t up to scratch! That means making sure the words in your bio are short, to the point, and contains conversation starters, and — crucially — your photos are *on point*!

Selfies are *out* and high-quality, recent pics are *in!*

If you have access to a DSLR, put it to use by taking fire photos for your profile. But, if you don’t, then the best thing is to leave it to the professionals, and get in touch with The Match Artist!

Our professional photographers will work with you to give your profile the boost it needs and help you get more matches, all without having to upgrade to Tinder Gold!

Just [check out our case studies](https://thematchartist.com/case-studies) and see how it changed up the dating game for our past clients!

### Can You Tell if Someone Has Tinder Gold?

No, you can’t tell if someone has Tinder Gold, unless they’ve sent you a Like, you’re both Tinder Gold users, and you’re in the Likes You feed (you can find this at the bottom of your screen in the app).

### Does Tinder Gold Boost You?

Tinder Gold can boost your profile in the sense that if you use the Like button on another user who also has Tinder Gold, they can see that you’re serious about the app, about dating, and potentially about them.

However, it doesn’t boost you in the same way that the Boost (the purple lightning bolt icon) or Super Boost features do, which increases visibility of your profile by pushing you to the top of all match queues for a period of time.

### Why Does It Say Thanks to Tinder Gold?

Tinder used to send a message saying that you’d matched “thanks to Tinder Gold”, which was something to indicate that the other user had upgraded to Tinder Gold. However, this appears to have been replaced with a gold heart icon against the other person’s profile, instead.

## Navigating Tinder Gold Features

Tinder Gold isn’t too tricky to get your head around, and once you know what the added benefits could do for your profile views and comments, you’ll know why it’s such a valuable asset.

Here’s what you need to know!

### Who Is the Golden Heart Given to?

If you have Tinder Gold, when you Like someone, if they also have Tinder Gold and are in their Likes You feed, they’ll see a gold heart next to your name. This is to indicate to them that you’re a Tinder Gold user.

### Why Is the Golden Heart Feature Provided?

While it’s no guarantee, knowing that another user has upgraded their account to one of the premium subscriptions could indicate that they’re serious about using the app, dating, and meeting people.

If you’re serious about Tinder and are looking for love, a relationship, or even marriage, this can be helpful in weeding out casual users who are only on the app to alleviate boredom, rather than take action!

That means less time spent mindlessly reading and Swiping through profiles, more time spent cultivating real connections that could in part lead to relationships!

### Who Can Use the Tinder Golden Heart Feature?

In order to have access to golden hearts, you must sign up for Tinder Gold.

### How Do You Get Gold Status on Tinder?

To upgrade your account to Tinder Gold:

* Open your Tinder app
* Tap on the Profile icon, followed by Settings
* Select Tinder Gold.

You’ll be charged through either the App or Google Play store. If you want to discontinue your subscription, you’ll also need to cancel it through your app store.

### Should I Swipe if I Have Tinder Gold?

While you can continue to Swipe as normal if you have Tinder Gold, it’ll be far easier to look at your Likes You feed, where you’ll see a list of names who have already Liked your profile. That way, you can instantly <a href="https://thematchartist.com/tinder/do-girls-get-more-matches-tinder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">match with other users</a>, without wondering if they Like you as well!

However, continuing to Swipe could indicate to the algorithm that you’re still actively using the app, and may therefore affect your visibility on the app and quality of your matches.

## Handling Gold Hearts on Tinder

Once you’ve got Tinder Gold, here’s what you need to know!

### Can I Hide the Yellow Heart on Tinder?

Unfortunately, you can’t hide your yellow heart on Tinder from other Tinder Gold users if you’ve sent them a Like and they’re viewing their Likes You feed.

### Tips for Using Tinder Gold Hearts

If you’ve upgraded to Tinder Gold, when you Like someone, your Likes will automatically show up as Gold Hearts in the Likes You feed for others. However, here are some of our top tips with Tinder Gold:

* **Keep your cool**

Receiving a Like from someone using Tinder Gold is a great indicator that they’re interested. However, immediately Swiping Right on them as soon as you get the notification, may be a little too “keen bean”, so take your time to read through their profile, and check out their linked social posts (if any).

Just because someone has Swiped Right on you with Tinder Gold, doesn’t mean that you’re obligated to return the Like! Ensure that you’re only matching with others who you really feel a connection with.

* **No need to Swipe all day**

Thanks to the Likes You feed, you can skip trawling through the app throughout the day and instead review who’s Liked your profile at the end of the day, and respond as necessary.

* **Don’t forget about the other premium features**

With Tinder Gold you’ll have access to Boosts and Super Likes, which could help you <a href="https://thematchartist.com/tinder/how-to-get-more-matches-tinder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make a few more matches</a>. Just be sure to use them wisely and sparingly!

### You Matched Thanks to Tinder Gold: Meaning and Implications

As mentioned, if you receive a gold heart notification, indicating that another Tinder Gold member has Liked your profile, this could help you narrow down whether they’re serious about the app and dating, or not.

*Tinder’s a pretty big sea, after all, and there’s a lot of fish out there!*

However, this means that it’s also important to be clear about your intentions and boundaries once you do match with someone. After all, just because you’ve both Liked each other doesn’t mean that you’re necessarily compatible, nor looking for the same thing from your relationships.

Users who lay out their intentions from the start generally have a better experience on the app, as it may help clarify things when issues arise.

## Deciphering Other Tinder Symbols

Of course, hearts aren’t the only symbols you’ll find on the app. Here are a couple more you’ll likely see and what they mean.

### What Does the Gold Diamond Mean on Tinder?

If you see a gold diamond next to a person’s name, this is an indication that they are one of your Top Picks. It will only appear gold if you’re a Tinder Gold user. You can access these match lists in your Top Picks feed.

### What Does the Dice Mean on Tinder?

If you see the red dice icon in a private chat room, clicking it will generate a random conversation starter for you — not a bad feature if you need a little guidance to get chatting!

## Key Takeaways

Tinder Gold is one of the premium subscriptions available to Tinder users. If you choose to upgrade your account to Tinder Gold, you’ll have access to a number of features, including access to the Likes You feed.

In the Likes You feed, you’ll not only be able to see who has Swiped Right on your profile, you’ll also be able to see if they have a Tinder Gold account: you’ll see a gold heart next to their name.

Likewise, if you Like another user, a gold heart will appear next to your name in their Likes You feed.

Knowing that someone has Tinder Gold and has Liked your profile may influence your decision about whether or not to Swipe Right on them. For starters, knowing that they have Liked your profile takes the anxiety out of the equation, but it also shows that they’re serious about using the app, and potentially about finding a relationship.

If this matches your intentions for using Tinder Gold and you’re sufficiently interested in the other person, this could help you make your decision.

While Tinder Gold has plenty of features that may help you make connections on Tinder, our top advice is still to make sure that the text in your bio is interesting, captivating, and to the point, and your photos show you off in your best light!

While we can’t write your Tinder bio for you, we can help with the photos! So, if you need a professional guiding hand, [get in touch with The Match Artist today](https://thematchartist.com/online-dating-photographer-near-me), and let’s start you on your journey to better matches!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do matches know you have Tinder Gold?

### What does the gold heart with lines mean on Tinder?

The gold heart with lines on Tinder is the logo for Likes sent with a Tinder Gold subscription.
