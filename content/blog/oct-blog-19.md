## What is a Match on Dating App?

Getting a match on a dating app means that two parties have shown interest in each other’s dating profiles. Each person thinks the other could be a match. A conversation can begin once you have matched with someone on a dating app.

The exact matching system works slightly differently depending on your dating app, but the general premise is the same. First, you see a profile. Next, if you want to get to know the person, you indicate that you want to start a conversation.

One account confirms interest in another through features such as likes, swipes, or another form of selection.

Once you have expressed interest in someone, they can respond in kind. If you both like or swipe on each other's profiles, you have now matched and can exchange messages!

## Is It Normal to Get No Matches on Dating Apps?

When you first start using a dating app, it is normal not to receive matches immediately. For one, you haven’t reached out to many people yet, making it difficult for a match to occur. You’ve got to stack up the swipe rights before they can start swiping back!

Your profile has only been active for a short while, meaning few people have yet to see it. You might also be working on completing your profile. An incomplete profile may also limit how many people see your profile.

But if you’ve consistently used dating apps and are still without matches, there are likely other factors to blame.

Struggling to find a partner on a dating app can make you feel worthless or pathetic. It can even make you feel friendless if you are using these apps to make new friends in your area!

But there is no reason for you to feel lonely, humiliated, or neglected. In reality, getting no matches may be no fault of your own.

You can easily make a few fundamental changes to your dating profile. These changes will significantly increase your chance of success when looking for the love of your life.

So, if nothing is working and you think you’re out of luck regarding dating apps, stick around. We’ve got a range of tips! Stuff that most people don’t consider when trying out dating apps.
