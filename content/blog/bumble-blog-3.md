# What Does Moderated Mean on Bumble?

Have you ever logged into Bumble and had a notification that your profile or one of your pictures has been moderated? Or perhaps you’ve been browsing your matches and noticed that one of them has their username set as “moderated?”

Well, worry no longer, as we’ve got all the answers when it comes to moderation on Bumble!

In this article we’ll cover:

* What Bumble is
* Things to understand about Bumble’s moderation system
* Whether or not you can appeal your moderation on Bumble
* Frequently asked questions.

Let’s get into it!

## What Is Bumble?

[Bumble](http://bumble.com) is an innovative social networking app that requires women to make the first move in heterosexual matches when using Bumble Date.

This [feature makes it different](https://thematchartist.com/bumble/bumble-screenshots/) from apps like Tinder and Badoo, and provides a unique dynamic that encourages respect and equality in dating.

Created by an ex-Tinder founder, Bumble has set itself apart by also offering Bumble Bizz and Bumble BFF modes. This allows for professional networking and finding friends online, rather than being a sole [dating app](https://thematchartist.com/bumble/bumble-hookups-or-dating/).

### How Does Bumble Work?

After you create a profile (you must provide a photo, name, and personal information, such as your age), you can browse through potential matches. [Filters](https://bumble.com/en/help/what-are-filters-and-advanced-filters) are available so that you can tailor matches according to your preferences.

When two people swipe right, it’s a match! The point of difference is that in heterosexual matches, only the woman can make the first move.

If you swipe left on a profile, then you’ll simply move on to the next profile in your stack.

### What to Do If You’ve Been Moderated on Bumble?

If you’ve been moderated on Bumble then the first thing is not to panic! If you haven’t done anything wrong, you can try getting your profile unmoderated.

[Contact Bumble’s customer support](https://bumble.com/en/contact-us) and describe in detail why you think your moderation is unjust. They’ll be able to review your account, and this will hopefully result in your account being reinstated!

Usually, being moderated is a sign something you’ve done goes against the company’s [community guidelines](https://bumble.com/en/guidelines), but errors can occur!

According to their [privacy statement](https://bumble.com/en-us/privacy), moderation is done by in-person moderators as well as automated processes, so there is the potential for mistakes.

### Can You Have Two Bumble Accounts?

No, having multiple accounts on Bumble is against their terms of service. This measure ensures a genuine, safe environment where users can trust the profiles they interact with.

Stick to one account to respect the community rules and ensure a positive experience for all. Having multiple accounts is a violation, and may result in getting moderated.

## Understanding Bumble Moderation

In order to avoid getting moderated, it’s helpful to know what it means to be moderated on Bumble and how to avoid it.

Let’s dive in!

### What Does It Mean to be Moderated on Bumble?

Being moderated on Bumble means your profile or content has been flagged for potentially violating the platform’s community guidelines. It’s Bumble’s way of keeping track of any behavior that may negatively affect other users.

[Common reasons](https://bumble.com/en/help/why-was-i-blocked-from-bumble) for being moderated include:

* Posting inappropriate content
* Being disrespectful of other users
* Spamming or scamming
* Soliciting or other suspicious activities.

### What Does It Mean When a Photo Is Moderated on Bumble?

If a [photo is moderated](https://bumble.com/en/help/why-has-my-photo-been-moderated) on Bumble, it means the picture has violated the platform’s photo guidelines. This is different from when your account is moderated.

If a photo is moderated it just means it has been taken down, but you’ll still have access to your account.

The list of what Bumble doesn’t allow in profile pictures includes:

* Pictures in underwear/nudity
* Shirtless mirror selfies
* Swimwear pictures indoors
* Pictures of kids by themselves
* Pictures of guns
* Graphic hunting pictures
* Pictures that don’t show your face.

If you’re not sure why your picture has been moderated, you can [contact Bumble customer support](https://bumble.com/en/contact-us) by going to the settings menu and clicking on the “Contact & FAQ” button. They’ll be able to explain the reasoning behind the moderation.

### What Does It Mean When Your Account Is Moderated?

When your account is moderated it means that your entire [profile is under review](https://thematchartist.com/bumble/bumble-fake-profiles/) because it’s been reported for violating community guidelines or for suspicious activity. You won’t be able to access your account, any of your matches, comments, or messages.

### Why Do You Need Content Moderation on Dating Site?

Content moderation is crucial on dating sites to maintain a safe, respectful, and positive community. It helps weed out inappropriate content, protect others from offensive or harmful behavior, and ensure the service is being used for its intended purpose.

In essence, it helps users feel safe while making connections.

## Can you Appeal Bumble Moderation?

So your account has been moderated and you can’t use it any more. Is there anything you can do?

Although Bumble doesn’t have any formal appeal procedure, you can contact them and explain why you believe your ban was in error.

According to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/ikvl3l/accidentally_got_banned_from_bumble_is_there_any/)users, it is quite unusual to get your account back again after being banned on Bumble, so don’t set your expectations too high!

### How Long Is a Bumble Ban?

A Bumble ban is permanent, unless you are able to successfully appeal.

### How Do You Know If Someone Reported You on Bumble?

Bumble maintains user privacy, so they won’t directly inform you if someone reports you. However, if your account or content is moderated or banned as a result of a report, Bumble will notify you about the moderation action taken.

If you’ve recently interacted with a match and things ended badly, you can probably assume that they’re the ones that reported you, but there’s no way to know for certain.

## Key Takeaways

Bumble has a moderation system in place to ensure users obey the community guidelines.

If one of your pictures is moderated, it will be removed from your profile. If your entire profile is moderated, it means you’ve been banned and you’ll need to contact Bumble to try to get your profile reactivated.

Bumble bans are permanent unless you’re able to successfully appeal. You won’t be able to find out who reported you if you are banned.

The best way to avoid moderation is to make sure you’re aware of the rules in the Bumble Community guidelines, and make sure your pictures align with Bumble’s rules.

Avoid getting moderated at all by making sure you stay respectful of other users, optimize your profile, and get in touch with The Match Artist for your profile pics!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I know if my boyfriend is on Bumble?

There’s no way to know for sure — unless you come across his picture while swiping!

If you’re feeling unsure, try having an open and honest chat with your boyfriend and letting him know your concerns.

### How can I see if my husband is on a dating site?

There’s no foolproof way to know if your husband is on a dating site without either stumbling upon their profile or them telling you directly.

While snooping on his phone is an option, this is unlikely to end well and will probably lead to more conflict. It’s best to discuss any concerns directly with your husband for clarity and resolution.

### How do you know if someone is a bot on Bumble?

It can be hard to tell if someone on a dating app is a bot, but there are some [subtle signs](https://www.wikihow.com/Spot-a-Bot-on-Tinder)!

Here are some of the most easy to spot clues that someone is a bot:

* Their profile looks too perfect. Bots often use professional photographs stolen from anyone on social media
* The conversation feels scripted
* They try to get you to click on external links
* They quickly ask for your phone number
* Their responses are lightning quick
* They don’t seem to get your jokes or sarcasm
* They’re not linked to an Instagram or spotify account
* They use your name a lot.

Bumble tries to detect and remove bots, but if you suspect a profile is a bot, you can (and should) report them.
