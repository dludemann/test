## What is Catfishing?

The term ‘catfishing’ originated in 2010 on the MTV show ‘Catfish,’ hosted by Nev Schulman. At its most basic, catfishing is the act of pretending to be someone else online. Catfishes may use the name and photos of an existing person to impersonate them or fabricate a new person and identity entirely.

Catfishing can happen to anyone, but it is most common on dating apps. This can be frustrating, as dating apps can be a great way to meet a [future long-term partner](https://thematchartist.com/blog/can-online-dating-lead-to-marriage). But with catfish in the mix, it can seem intimidating and even potentially dangerous.

### Why Do People Catfish?

What is the point of catfishing, and what’s the end goal? People decide to catfish others for a variety of reasons. They may be running scams and aiming for financial gain or simply want to prank or ‘troll’ the person they are catfishing.

## Why is It Essential to Identify Catfishing?

So, why is it so important to identify and quickly snuff out catfishing? Why is it dangerous to be caught in one of those situations? You should watch for the warning signs of catfishing for several reasons.

### Personal Safety

Someone catfishing you may learn details about your personal life that you would not typically want to share with a stranger. Information such as your address or workplace can be dangerous in the wrong hands. Therefore, you should always be cautious when sharing personal information online.

### Emotional Well-being

The experience of being catfished can take a severe emotional toll on a person and significantly lower their self-esteem. Your trust is broken, and you may feel betrayed or foolish for believing the catfish's lies. While it is never the victim's fault, the emotional repercussions of being catfished can be challenging to deal with.

### Financial Security

Catfishing is becoming increasingly common as a means of scamming victims out of money. You should ensure that you only give money to people on the internet if you are certain they are who they say they are.

### Data Protection

There is always the chance that someone will catfish you to get your data. Catfish could be after anything from your social media passwords to your bank information. Ensure your data is always thoroughly protected, and do not give information to anyone over the internet.

### Maintain Genuine Connections

Fostering online connections is great, but you should ensure all your relationships are genuine. Ensuring that all the relationships in your life are real and authentic will help you direct your energy toward the connections that matter. Fostering sincere connections is also essential when [finding people to date](https://thematchartist.com/blog/how-do-i-meet-singles-in-my-area).

### Avoid Wasted Time

You don’t want to waste time and effort building a relationship that turns out to be a lie. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that your online connections are real and worth your time and energy.

### Mental Health Implications

Getting catfished can have a severe impact on your mental health. The betrayal and stress you endure as a victim of catfishing may lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and paranoia. Protect your mental health by ensuring all of the relationships in your life are genuine and healthy.

## How to Know If You're Being Catfished

One fundamental question remains: how exactly do you know if you’re being catfished? Is the woman or man of my dreams who they say they are? Let’s discuss a few primary signs to look out for!

### Profile Picture Looks Too Perfect

A high-quality, professionally taken profile picture of an extraordinarily attractive person is (unfortunately) unlikely to be real. You always want to check the authenticity of profile pictures that look just a bit too perfect!

### Reluctance to Video Call

One of the tell-tale signs that someone may be a catfish is a continued reluctance to get on the phone and video chat. Not wanting to be seen on camera in real-time often indicates that someone is not who they say they are.

### Vague Personal Details

Another hint that someone may be catfishing you is when they only offer vague personal details. Catfish don’t want to risk forgetting any false information they have given out and getting caught in their web of lies, so they intentionally keep personal details vague.

### Rapid Intimacy

A catfish is likely trying to get something from you, often quickly. Whether a catfish is after money or favors, they want you to like them immediately. Catfish tend to do this by becoming rapidly intimate with you, hoping you will reciprocate.

### Avoiding Personal Questions

Another typical red flag is avoiding personal questions. It can be difficult for catfish to keep track of their lies, so they often try not to answer any personal questions so they don’t risk exposure.

### Asking for Money

One key sign of a catfish is requesting you send them money. It could be a little or a lot. Be very wary of strangers on the internet asking you for money, and never give out banking information.

### Too Good to Be True

If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. If the person you are talking to on the internet is gorgeous, funny, and has the same interests as you, that may be a sign to dig deeper into their identity.

### Different Social Media Footprints

Often, a catfish will have a different social media footprint than most others on the internet. If the person you are talking to says they have no social media accounts other than the platform you use to communicate, that is a red flag.

It is also suspicious if they have other social media, but the accounts have all been made very recently and have little to no content or followers. Checking out Instagram or Facebook profiles is an excellent way to identify a catfish.

### Language and Grammar

It is common for a catfish to have poor language and grammar skills. Often, these catfish are from a different country from those they are catfishing and are just pretending to live in similar locations.

You may notice that they speak in a manner that suggests English (or whatever your native tongue is) is not their first language, and they merely pretend it is.

### Defensiveness

Above all else, a catfish hates being caught. If you begin to suggest that this person is not who they say they are and they become immediately defensive, then this may be a sign that your suspicions are correct.

### Pressure to Move Off the Platform

Catfishers generally want to operate in a familiar space, so they may pressure you to move off the platform you are speaking on. If someone is insistent that you switch to text messages or WhatsApp, this may be a sign of a catfish.

### Links and Phishing

A prevalent online attack is phishing, in which users send you a link that steals your data once you click it. If someone sends you an unfamiliar link, they may be a catfish. Be cautious and only click on the link if you are certain it is safe.

### Stories Don't Add Up

If someone tells you a story that does not align with the information they have previously told you, there is a good chance that they are a catfish. Pay attention to information they have said in the past and whether this lines up with other stories they tell you.

### Friends and Family are Skeptical

Others in your life, such as your family and friends, might be skeptical about someone you are talking to online. This can be a sign to step back and consider whether this person is a catfish. Sometimes, it takes people outside the situation to recognize something is amiss.

## Recognizing a Fake Profile

How do you recognize a [fake profile online](https://thematchartist.com/tinder/is-tinder-full-of-fake-profiles)? What things should you look out for? There are a few key ways to determine whether the profile you are messaging is real or fake.

### Reverse Image Search

If you come across a profile photo that seems too good to be true, a reverse image search is one of the easiest ways to determine its authenticity. A quick Google search will also reveal if a photo has been stolen from another online source.

### Professional Photos or Stock Images

If someone's profile photo is professional with a watermark logo or a stock image, chances are they are catfish. There is a slim chance they have had professional photos taken of themselves. If this is the case, they will often have access to the un-watermarked versions of these photos.

### Fake Personal Details

If the personal details listed on someone's online profile don’t add up, they may be a catfish. Chances are the person you are talking to is not a world record holder who owns a billion-dollar company and graduated from Harvard Law. Look for unbelievable or unlikely details in a person's profile.

## How to Save Yourself from Being Catfished

You want to protect yourself and your peace of mind at all costs, which means not falling victim to catfishing. Fortunately, you can take a few measures and precautions to ensure you do not get catfished.

### Do Your Research

When you meet someone online, do some research before forming a relationship with them. Check whether they have other social media accounts, and reverse image search their profile photo.

### Never Share Too Much

You should never give out personal information on the internet, especially not to strangers. Keep information private, such as your bank details, your address, or your place of work.

### Look Out for the Signs

When talking to strangers on online platforms or dating apps, look for red flags or signs of deception. Tell-tale signs include making excuses not to video call, very poor language and grammar, or providing links to suspicious websites. Even having a bad gut feeling may indicate that you are talking to catfishers or scammers.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Who is Most Likely to be Catfished?

&nbsp;

Anyone can be catfished, though studies and articles suggest that older women are more likely to be targeted. Catfishers and scammers target older people because they believe them to be less tech-savvy and, therefore, easier to scam.

### How Do You End a Catfish Relationship?

The best way to end a catfish relationship is to cut it off as soon as you identify the tell-tale signs. Although this may seem harsh, a catfish will likely latch onto any hesitation and try to continue to deceive or scam you.

### Do Catfish Fall in Love?

While a catfish can fall in love with the person they were initially deceiving, it is difficult to determine whether their feelings are genuine or fabricated. This lack of trust can make it challenging to form candid relationships.<br>Sources:
