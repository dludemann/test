# Can You Send Pictures on Tinder? A Comprehensive Guide for 2023

We all know that a picture can say a thousand words — but can you send a picture to another user on Tinder?

In this guide we’re going to cover:

* What Tinder is
* Everything you need to know about starting conversations on Tinder
* Tinder’s policy when it comes to sending pictures to other users
* Alternative workarounds for sending pictures
* What you should know about safety and privacy on Tinder
* How to manage your Tinder profile with pictures
* Frequently asked questions.

Let’s get straight into it!

## What Is Tinder?

Tinder is an online dating app, started in 2012 by Sean Rad and Joe Munoz in Hollywood California. Tinder is one of the most popular dating apps worldwide, with 75 million users each month, including 7.8 million in the U.S. alone.

Primarily a mobile platform, designed to be used on your handheld device, you can also use it on your desktop, though functionality on the site is somewhat different.

In addition to the basic free version of the app, users also have the option to upgrade their subscription to Tinder Plus, Tinder Gold, or Tinder Platinum for a monthly fee.

The Tinder algorithm shows you a number of profiles per day within your location (you can set your location radius in your settings) which it thinks you may be interested in, and can choose to Swipe on. It puts this together based on your “desirability”, activity on the app, and information that you provide when signing up.

You will need a mobile number to sign up for Tinder. This information is held by Tinder to prevent you from signing up for an additional account (which is against their terms of use).

### Workarounds for Sending Pictures on Tinder

Tinder, unfortunately, doesn’t allow you to send pictures directly through the app. However, there are a couple of workarounds and options:

* Upload the image to an image hosting service and send the URL directly to your recipient
* Send your image off the app directly to her phone number through text or other messaging platforms (ie, Telegram, WhatsApp, or Signal)
* Upload the image as an additional profile photo, then remove it
* Upload your image as a GIF to Giphy, which will allow you to send it as a GIF to your recipient through Tinder
* Send a Bitmoji instead
* Have a video chat conversation

We’ll cover these in greater detail later.

### Tinder Matches and Messaging

When browsing through Tinder, you can indicate your interest in another user by Swiping Right on their profile (Like), or move on to another profile by Swiping Left (pass).

If two users Swipe Right on each other, they’ll make a match, and be placed in a private chat room. From here you can message each other indefinitely like text messages (unless one or the other decides to unmatch), get chatting, and make a connection!

### What Is the Purpose of Tinder?

Tinder is primarily a dating app, meaning that singles use the app to meet other like minded individuals. While some men and women may be looking for relationships or even love, Tinder has a reputation as a bit of a hookup app. Some people have even found new friends through the service!

## Starting Conversations on Tinder

Starting conversations on Tinder may seem a little intimidating, but don’t worry! Everyone is in the same boat when it comes to <a href="https://thematchartist.com/tinder/best-first-text-tinder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sending their first texts</a>.

Here’s a few methods for handling sending that first message to someone.

### How to Start a Conversation on Tinder

When starting your conversation on Tinder, there’s a few things to keep in mind:

* **Keep it short**

Your first message on Tinder should be a conversation starter — that means no giant essays! Keep it short, sharp, and simple.

* **Add humor if you can**

If you can make your match laugh, that’s a great place to start! You can even start with a cheesy joke or pick-up line, as long as you make it clear that you’re kidding.

* **Show your personality off**

Anybody can start with a “hey” but it doesn’t tell the other person very much about yourself! Try to showcase your personality a little bit better and give the other person something to respond to.

* **“Read the room”**

If it looks like your recipient would be open to it (*hint: read their profile!*), you can afford to be a little cheeky or flirty. But if they don’t seem like the kind of person who may appreciate that sort of behavior, keep things a bit more chill for your opening communication.

* **Focus on the other person**

Your conversation starter is exactly that: the start of a conversation. Try to focus on the other person’s interests, images, linked social media accounts, such as Instagram or Spotify. After all, for your first message, you’re just looking for a response!

### How to Send Personal Pictures on Tinder Chat

As noted, you can’t send pictures directly in the Tinder chat window. However, as mentioned, there’s a few workarounds for this restriction.

1. **Upload the image to an image hosting service**

While you can’t send your image to someone directly through Tinder, there’s nothing stopping you from uploading your image to a hosting service (for example Imgur or even your Google Drive) and then sending the link on to your match.

2. **Send your image off the app**

Of course, the simplest way to start chatting and be able to send picture messages is if you take things off Tinder. That may be sending a text directly to your match’s phone, or using a messaging service such as WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, or Facebook Messenger.

3. **Upload the image as an additional profile photo**

While you can’t send an image to your match directly in the chatbox, one workaround is to upload an additional profile photo to your gallery and tell your match to check your profile pictures.

Of course, your profile pictures are public, so you run the risk here that anybody could see an image intended for their eyes only! You’ll just have to be quick to remove it once they’ve seen it.

4. **Upload your image as a GIF**

Tinder’s GIF service is connected to Giphy, which means that if you’re smart about it, you can actually upload your images as a GIF to Giphy, then send it directly to your match from the app.

To do this, follow these steps:

* Download Giphy and open the app
* Select the “Upload from Camera Roll” option, browse images in your photo library, and add media
* Make sure you tag your image so you can find it again on Tinder
* Tap the “Upload to Giphy” button.

Now all you have to do is open your Tinder app, search for your images on Giphy, and you can send them to anyone on the app!

5. **Send a Bitmoji**

Bitmojis are a type of animation, similar in style to memes. They’re stickers featuring a cartoon version of yourself, generated through SnapChat, and you can send them directly through Tinder’s chat. While they aren’t exactly an image (they’re probably closer to a GIF), this is one way of sending something other than an emoji or picture!

To send a Bitmoji to your potential date:

* Click the green smiley face at the bottom of your text chat box
* Enter your SnapChat details in the pop-up.

And, if you don’t want your match to know your SnapChat handle — don’t worry! Tinder won’t give it out on your behalf.

6. **Direct your match to your social media**

An easy way to show someone images without needing to go through the rigamarole of uploading images and sending URL links, is simply by redirecting your match to a place where your images may already be! Eg, your Instagram. Just give them your social media username handle and away you go!

### Tips for Using Tinder

First and foremost, when using Tinder, you should remember that though you want to be open and honest with potential matches, you should never give out any personal information that may be a threat to your safety.

This could include:

* Your address
* Your personal phone number (until you’re ready)
* Work place
* Social security details
* Credit card information.

Additionally, to protect yourself, try to avoid profile pictures that may reveal places you like to frequent. Remember that the internet is a public forum and you don’t want everyone in the world to have access to you!

However, Tinder is all about meeting people! Safely, of course. So, don’t be afraid to divulge details such as your interests, ideas, opinions, and things that make you *you*. After all, if you’re too cautious, then what are your reasons for being on Tinder in the first place?

Those who have the most success on Tinder have:

* Filled out their profile completely
* An interesting, short and snappy bio, with clear conversation starters
* Made it clear what they’re looking for (without it sounding like a shopping list) and dealbreakers (without it sounding too negative)
* *Excellent* profile pictures.

While that may seem like a lot to take on board, really, it’s quite simple! You’re selling yourself, so make sure your “content” is interesting!

While we can’t write your profile for you, we can definitely help when it comes to your profile photos. When you work with The Match Artist, we’ll take you through a comprehensive survey so that we can get to understand who you are, your story, and what you’re looking for.

From there, we’ll pair you with one of our talented professional photographers, who’ll arrange your four to five hour personal photoshoot. We aim to take a range of photos, in different settings, outfits, and times of day, finishing around sunset so we can capture you in the golden hour!

After that, within a couple of weeks, you’ll have your edited photos, all ready to go, and from there all you’ll have to do is sit back and watch the matches come pouring in!

And trust us — they really get results! Just ask some of [our past clients](https://thematchartist.com/reviews)!

## Picture Sending Capabilities on Tinder

So, what’s the deal with Tinder’s picture sending capabilities, and why won’t they let you send them through the app? We’ve got the answers to your questions!

### How to Upload Pictures to Your Tinder Profile Just for One Person to See

While, technically, you can’t upload pictures to your Tinder profile directly for one person, if you’re smart about it and *quick*, you can upload a new profile picture, tell your match to check it out, then quickly remove it again.

This method won’t *guarantee* that only one person sees it, but it is possible.

### Why Doesn’t Tinder Let You Send Photos?

Tinder used to let you send photos through the app, but likely due to too many unsolicited photos (*aka, you-know-what pics!*), the feature was removed. You can still send GIFs, emojis, and Bitmojis, though.

### Can You Send Pictures on Tinder in Messages?

The only way to send pictures on Tinder to another user is by following the steps outlined above.

## Alternative Picture Sending Strategies

As we’ve already mentioned, there are a number of alternative strategies you can employ to send your picture to your Tinder match.

While we’ve already covered some of these, here they are again in a little more detail!

### Sending GIFs and Bitmojis on Tinder

If you want to send your image directly through Tinder, you can upload it to Giphy as a GIF.

Simply:

* Download Giphy and open the app
* Select “Upload from Camera Roll” and upload your image
* Tag your image so you can find it
* Tap the “Upload to Giphy” button.

Of course, you don’t have to send a custom GIF — you can also pick one from the thousands already on Giphy!

If you want to send a Bitmoji, simply:

* Click the green smiley icon in the bottom corner of your chat (next to the GIF icon)
* Enter your SnapChat details in the pop-up.

### How to Send Photo Links to Your Matches on Tinder

For the purposes of this example, we’re going to use Imgur as our image hosting service, but any one will do.

To send a photo link to your match on Tinder:

* Open a new Internet browser window
* Navigate to the Imgur homepage
* Navigate to the “New Post” button (top left-hand corner of the page)
* Upload your image
* Copy the URL and send it to your match.

### Utilizing Third-Party Apps to Send Pics on Tinder

Third-party apps may include WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, SnapChat, Instagram, Twitter, or any other off-app service.

All you need to do to get your match to head over to your desired platform is give them your username handle, or exchange phone numbers.

Just remember, if you decide to use an app which requires you to give out your personal phone number, you’ll be letting that person into your inner circle. So, proceed with caution!

### How to Send Pictures on Tinder via a Link

Sending pictures via a link is very similar to the process of sending a link to an image hosting service. Wherever you [have your photos uploaded](https://thematchartist.com/tinder/what-photos-attract-girls-tinder/) — eg, your Google Drive — you’ll just have to copy the URL and send it in your chat to your match.

### Using Google Photos for Sharing Images

If you have Google Photos and you’d like to share your images with your match, you can choose to share either an individual photo or album.

To do this:

* Download the Google Photos app and sign in
* Select the photo or album you’d like to share
* Tap “Share”
* Tap “Send in Google Photos” and add the email address of the person you’d like to share the image with
* Tap “Send”.

## Safety and Privacy Considerations

It’s important to bear in mind not only your personal safety and privacy on Tinder, but also that of others.

Tinder has a number of [terms of use](https://policies.tinder.com/summary-of-terms/intl/en-gb) and [community guidelines](https://policies.tinder.com/community-guidelines/intl/en) articles which you should be aware of, and which are in place to ensure the safety, rights, and privacy protection of everyone on the app.

Key things you should be aware of when it comes to images include:

* Boundaries of others are important, as is consent
* Be cautious of sharing personal information
* Violent content is strictly prohibited
* Don’t post others images or messages without their consent
* Don’t spam or exhibit abusive behavior.

Violation of any of the above, and more, could get you banned from the platform.

### Can You Take Screenshots on Tinder?

Yes, you can take screenshots on Tinder, though we’d caution you to do so carefully and respectfully.

### Does Tinder Notify Screenshots?

No, Tinder doesn’t notify users when screenshots are taken.

### Can You Have Private Photos on Tinder?

While you can’t make individual photos on Tinder private, you can hide your Tinder profile completely. If you upgrade to Tinder Plus, Tinder Gold, or Tinder Platinum, you can have more control over your profile settings, too.

### What Is the Photo Limit on Tinder?

You can upload a maximum of nine photos on your Tinder profile.

## Other Aspects of Tinder Profile Management

Finally, here’s what you need to know when it comes to your Tinder profile management with regards to images.

### What Part of Tinder Can Pictures Be Shared/Sent?

You can only share images on Tinder by uploading them to your profile, or using one of the workarounds listed in this article.

### What Formats Can Pictures Be Sent on Tinder?

You can either upload your image directly to Tinder in your profile pictures (JPEG, 640 x 640 px), or you can upload it to an image hosting service and send a URL link to your match.

### What Are Tinder Smart Photos All About?

Tinder Smart Photos is an AI feature that can automatically rearrange your profile photos for you, according to what it thinks will be your most popular image. By putting these images at the top of your profile, the idea is that you could get more people Swiping Right on you.

However, it collects this data according to people who have already Swiped on your profile, so if you haven’t been on the app for long, or have recently changed your photos, it may not be very accurate.

## Key Takeaways

When it comes to sending pictures directly on Tinder through their chat service, you won’t be able to do it directly, and will instead have to use a workaround. This is likely due to the fact that in the earlier days of Tinder, users were subjected to an overwhelming amount of inappropriate unsolicited images.

If you want to send an image to your Tinder match, you’ll have to use one of the following workarounds:

* Upload your image to an image hosting service, then share the link
* Upload your image as a new profile photo, then delete it after they’ve seen it
* Direct your match to a separate social media site
* Connect with your match off the app (eg, swop phone numbers)
* Upload your image as a custom GIF to Giphy.

Remember, you can also send regular GIFs and Bitmojis through the Tinder app.

We hope that helps you figure out how to work around Tinder’s image policy in chat! But if you’re looking to upgrade your Tinder profile so that you can make more matches and potentially take things off the app and into an IRL date, why not [get in touch with The Match Artist today](https://thematchartist.com/online-dating-photographer-near-me)?

We’ll help you take photos that *get you results* so you won’t have to worry too much about figuring out how to send images back and forth on a messaging app, because you’ll be too busy going on dates!
