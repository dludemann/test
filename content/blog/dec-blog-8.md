## Do Selfies on Tinder Work or Not?

Taking [pictures for dating apps](https://thematchartist.com/blog/dating-app-pictures)—whether Bumble, OKCupid, or Tinder—can be stressful.

Which ones do you select? Is there one that will perform better than others? There are many questions to consider.

Aside from your bio, your dating app profile photos are the first impression other users will get of you. If you want to make genuine connections online, pick the best photos that showcase who you are.

Based on our firsthand experience, many people ask whether including a selfie in their Tinder profile is a good idea. But there are pros and cons to using selfies on dating profiles.

### Pros and Cons of Using Selfies on Tinder

Suppose you decide between including selfies on your Tinder profile or doing away with them altogether. Here are some pros and cons that may make the decision a little easier:

#### Pros

* **Flattering:** Nobody knows your best angle like you do. Selfies can often turn out more flattering than off-guard pictures taken by your friends.
* **Simple:** Taking a selfie is as easy as pressing a button. Selfies are the way to go if you don’t want to put in much effort when crafting your Tinder profile.
* **Casual:** If you are a laid-back, informal person, selfies can often give off a casual air. Some people don’t want to give off this impression, others are all about it.

#### Cons

* **Boring**: A simple selfie doesn’t tell much about a person. A selfie can appear dull and generic compared to an action shot of you participating in one of your hobbies.
* **Misleading**: Carefully curated lighting, specific angles, filters. There are a range of reasons why people may not trust a selfie to show what a person looks like. If you want to gain the trust of other users on Tinder, a candid picture of you may be a better idea.
* **Overused**: Chances are, Tinder users who come across your profile have just swiped through countless selfies that look more or less the same. If you want to stand out from the crowd, try to avoid selfies.

## How to Take a Winning Selfie for Tinder as a Guy

Taking a selfie as a guy can feel like a struggle. It can be even more difficult if you are trying to capture the perfect selfie to use in your Tinder profile. If you’re looking for advice and tips, you’re in the right place.

### Guidelines for Capturing Perfect Tinder Selfies

There are a few things that contribute to taking the [perfect Tinder selfie](https://thematchartist.com/tinder/photos/). While the following points are not strict rules and can differ slightly from person to person, they are generally good guidelines:

* **Lighting:** The proper lighting in your selfie can make a difference, ensuring your face is well-lit. Natural lighting is best, so try taking selfies near a window.
* **Angles**: Determine which angles you look best at and use this to your advantage. It may take some practice (videoing yourself and reviewing the footage helps!), but it’s worth the extra effort. Also, ensure that you are entirely in frame but are not taking up too much space in the image.
* **Poses**: When posing for Tinder selfies, less is more. Avoid using a peace sign or other stereotypical ‘selfie poses.’ Instead, take a clear, plain shot that shows off your face.
* **Clarity**: There isn’t anything worse than checking out a Tinder profile and seeing all the photos are blurry, low-quality selfies. The other users will have no idea what you look like and will likely scroll past you.
* **Editing**: ** ** This is another aspect of Tinder selfies where less is more. In this case, it’s best to have no editing at all. If you digitally alter your features, people will discover your secret reasonably quickly once you get to in-person dates.

### Types of Selfies That Enhance Your Tinder Profile

You might’ve decided to include some selfies in your Tinder profile. In that case, it’s a great idea to use the specific types of selfies that are likely to perform better on the app. Cast away the boring selfies taken in front of a blank wall and consider some of these ideas instead:

#### Interactive

Have you ever seen a selfie of someone in a unique place—perhaps pretending to ‘hold’ the Eiffel Tower or another attraction? A selfie in which you interact with your background and surroundings will make you appear alive. This method will also help grab a swiper’s attention.

#### Fun

Colorful backgrounds, dynamic poses, genuine expressions – there are many ways to make a selfie more fun. A picture where you are staring blankly at the camera will not turn any heads. Take the opportunity to make your selfie (and the picture-taking process) a bit more fun!

#### Authentic

This is an important one, particularly for dating apps: authenticity. People want to have some idea of who you are as a person before they match with you.

So, try to appear authentic in your selfies. Take a selfie doing something you enjoy, or take a selfie with a genuine smile instead of a fake one.

## Selfie Mistakes That Could Hurt Your Tinder Success

While selfies can improve your Tinder experience in many ways, many selfie mistakes can hinder it. Aside from the basics, such as good angles and lighting, there are other selfie factors that everyone should consider.

### Avoiding Overused and Negative Selfie Trends

One selfie mistake to avoid is using negative selfie trends. It’s time to face the facts: ‘duck faces’ aren’t a good idea. There are also other selfie trends that you may want to avoid.

Shirtless selfies can often raise red flags. Both mirror selfies that cover the face and group selfies don’t perform well on Tinder. Keep your selfies simple, authentic, and free from popular trends or cliches.

The point is that you should prioritize self-expression and provide users with a sense of who you are. Do away with fake smiles—instead, try snapping a selfie while participating in activities you enjoy. Photos of you in your element will exhibit authenticity and are a great way to let others into your life and story.

## Balancing Your Tinder Gallery: Selfies and Other Photos

Including a selfie or two in your Tinder gallery? Great!

Have a gallery full of twenty selfies that all look the same? This is where issues arise.

Narrowing down your choices can be a problem. However, balancing the photos in your Tinder gallery is crucial and can land you more matches.

### Craft a Diverse Tinder Photo Gallery

You want to ensure you include varied photos for Tinder and other dating apps. A selfie or two is great, but including some candids is best.

Based on our observations, including candid photos will help users accurately understand what you look like. What’s more, authentic, eye-catching, and exciting photos will often prompt people to flirt and chat with you rather than swipe past.

Professional photographers can also be a handy tool. The results of these photoshoots can provide higher-quality images than smartphones can.

Engaging a professional photographer is also an excellent idea for those struggling with confidence. Professional photographers can often help you find your most flattering angles.

## Good vs Bad Selfies on Tinder

Using selfies on Tinder is only a good idea when done correctly. If you select bad selfies for your Tinder profile, your inbox may become barren. This is why you must use Tinder selfies that work.

However, it isn’t as simple as going onto your Instagram and picking the selfie with the most likes. The pics that your followers on social media enjoy won't necessarily be what works on dating apps.

### Tinder Selfies That Work

Some Tinder selfies will perform much better on the app than others. Before you take a selfie for your Tinder profile, try to keep this information in mind.

* **Action selfies**: Taking a selfie while engaging in an activity you enjoy, such as hiking, is a great way to add a touch of personality to the picture. This way, other users can get a good idea of what you look like and what some of your hobbies are.
* **Simple poses**: Overused selfie poses, and trends don’t perform well on dating apps. The focus should be on your face, and while posing confidently is excellent, try to avoid overly complex or cliche poses.
* **Genuine pictures**: An authentic expression is always better than a forced smile. Try choosing selfies for your Tinder profile that show you with a genuine, relaxed expression.

### Tinder Selfies that Do Not Work

Now for the Tinder selfies that do not work. Try to avoid selfies like these at all costs. Using these photos can significantly decrease your chances of finding a match on the app.

* **Group shots:** Nothing is worse than having to analyze a photo and spot the person you’re considering matching with somewhere in the crowd. Users want to know your appearance, not your friends and family. Try to avoid group shots, particularly with larger crowds.
* **Overly posed**: A selfie of you with a forced pose will likely look awkward and unnatural. Stick to selfies where you both look and feel natural and relaxed.
* **Low quality**: Low-quality pictures are often ignored on dating apps. Dimly lit, grainy, or pixelated pictures do not show off what you look like, and they can cause users to scroll right past you without a second look.

The good news? Even if you include some less effective pictures in your Tinder gallery, the new [Smart Photo feature](https://thematchartist.com/tinder/tinder-smart-photos/) will automatically reorder your photos. This handy feature reorders your photos based on their success rates and displays your best photos first.

## Key Takeaways

If you want to find some stellar matching success on Tinder, the first step is to have a great photo gallery. Using selfies on your Tinder profile can be terrific, but only if you do it correctly.

A range of factors influence whether your selfies are effective for dating apps. It’s essential to consider these before you upload photos to your profile.

Remember to keep your selfies simple and authentic, and don’t be afraid to showcase your authentic self. You should now be ready to revitalize your Tinder profile and on your way to a full inbox!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What Makes a Selfie Stand Out on Tinder?

A range of factors can make a selfie stand out on Tinder. Some important aspects are good lighting, clear image quality, natural poses, and exciting backgrounds.

### How Many Selfies Should I Include in My Tinder Profile?

Include anywhere from one to three selfies in your Tinder profile. You don’t want an entire gallery full of selfies. However, if you have a few high-quality, unique selfies, don’t be afraid to include them.

### Are Selfies Perceived Differently for Men and Women on Tinder?

Often, selfies taken by girls are considered more ‘acceptable’ on Tinder than by guys. This double standard is likely due to how society views women's relationships with selfies and the fact that they’re more commonplace for women. However, [a study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5399073/) has also shown that how men and women take selfies for Tinder differs significantly, which may affect how they are perceived.
