## What is Tinder?

Tinder is a popular dating app for finding singles and a potential partner in your area. Over 75 million people worldwide have Tinder profiles. Along with dating apps like Bumble and eHarmony, Tinder is among the most popular online dating platforms.

### How does Tinder Work?

Tinder’s matching process is very simple. You set up an account and input essential things such as your name, age, location, and gender.

You then specify your preferred distance radius for potential matches and gender preference. From here, you add profile photos and a short bio describing who you are.

The Tinder algorithm analyzes your data and uses an ‘ELO score’ to match you with compatible accounts. When presented with another Tinder account, a decision must be made. Swipe left or swipe right?

You can view the profiles of other accounts - their photos, bio, and information. You can tap left or right to scroll through their photos. You tap the middle of their photo and swipe down to view their information.

From there, you swipe right if you are interested, left if not. Two Tinder users swiping right on each other makes a match. Once a match has been made, the two accounts can start a chat and exchange messages with one another.

## Benefits of Using Tinder

There is a reason why Tinder is such a wildly popular dating app. There are several benefits of using Tinder to find someone you are interested in.

### Expansive User Base

With such a large user base, Tinder is a great platform to meet new people. Since the platform has so many users, you are far more likely to meet people you connect with.

### Simple Swiping Mechanism

Based on our firsthand experience, the Tinder app is dead simple to use, with its iconic simple swiping mechanism. The Tinder algorithm will present you with another account you will likely be a match with. All you need to do is swipe right if you are interested or left if you are not.

Certain Tinder subscriptions also offer the ‘Super Like’ feature. If you swipe up to Super Like an account, the other person will see this. If they swipe right back, it’s an immediate match!

### Rapid Profile Setup

Another positive aspect of Tinder is how quickly you can set up your profile. Creating and completing a Tinder account is fast and easy.

Anyone can set up a profile and swipe in no time. However, ensure you take a bit of time to get it right. Make that bio interesting, and upload the most flattering photos you can find!

### Geographic Flexibility with Passport Feature

Tinder Premium offers a unique feature for geographic flexibility with their ‘Tinder Passport’ feature. Tinder typically determines your location from your phone's GPS and only allows you to match with others in your area. Tinder Passport allows you to change your location and match with people in other areas - even all around the world!

### Diverse Range of Users

Since Tinder is so popular and accessible, the platform has diverse users. The more diverse dating pool means you are far more likely to meet people you would never ordinarily interact with.

This large and diverse pool increases the likelihood of finding that special someone. Someone you might never have connected with otherwise!
