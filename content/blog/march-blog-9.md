# **Should You Put Height in Your Tinder Bio?**

The debate over whether to include your height in Tinder bio has been going on for ages. One side argues that mentioning height upfront saves time and filters out mismatches, while others believe it’s just an unnecessary emphasis on physical attributes. This discussion can be a painful topic for some men, who may feel at a disadvantage in the online dating arena.

And, they aren’t completely false in their claims. [Survey from 2023.](https://www.eviemagazine.com/post/only-15-women-interest-58-men-dating-apps-according-survey) showed that women are way more likely to look for guys who are over 6 feet tall compared to heights below that. The same survey showed that they would rather date a 7-foot-tall man than a guy who is 5'11".

So, should you put height in the bio? That’s what we’ll cover in this article alongside answers to:

* Does height for short guys matter in a Tinder bio
* What are good Tinder bios for short guys
* Is Tinder implementing height settings

Let’s get to it!

## **Does Height Matter in a Tinder Bio, Especially If You Are a Short Guy?**

Many women cite height as an important factor, sometimes to to sense of safety or a preference for traditional gender roles where the man is taller. Of course, not all women prioritize height, so solely focusing on this attribute can be limiting.

On the other hand, dating experts think completely opposite - that height doesn’t matter. Some of their other insights are:

* Height is just one factor among many that can attract or repel potential matches.
* Confidence and humor are often more attractive than height alone.
* Highlighting unique interests and personality traits can make height less relevant.

## **What Are Some Good Tinder Bios to Put If You Are a Short Guy?**

Here are some examples of witty and confident Tinder bios:

* "5'7" but my personality is 6'2"."
* "The Romans were 5’5 and conquered the world."
* "I may be short, but I’m big on making people laugh."

But, what if you want some tips on how to write a[<u>good bio</u>](https://thematchartist.com/tinder/hot-bios)? We got you covered! Here are some:

1. Mention hobbies, passions, and other interests
2. Use humor, wit, or unique insights
3. Be positive
4. Talk about what matters to you
5. Be honest

### **Embrace Your Height Positively**

Instead of viewing your height as a limitation, you should try to frame it positively. You don’t want to come out as insecure and desperate. Height shouldn’t define you as a person. Ask yourself this: Aside from playing in the NBA, what can’t you do that people taller than you can?

Here are some examples of funny statements you can write in your bio to appear light-hearted about your height:

* "Not tall enough to reach the top shelf, but I’ll always reach for your heart."
* "Good things come in small packages."
* "Short guy, big heart. And yes, I can ride all the rides at Disney World."

### **Highlight Your Other Qualities**

Highlight other qualities and interests instead of focusing on your height, like:

* Passion for cooking or a specific cuisine
* Love for outdoor adventures or travel
* Skills in music, art, or sports
* Career achievements or academic pursuits
* Volunteer work or community involvement

When you want to weave these qualities into your bio in a more natural way start by highlighting how they shape your daily life and then connect them to your personal and professional experiences. Just remember to be concise when writing your bio.

### **Use Photos to Your Advantage**

Types of photos that you could put on your profile:

* High-quality, well-lit images
* Photos showcasing your interests (e.g., hiking, cooking)
* [Shirtless photos](https://thematchartist.com/tinder/shirtless-pictures/) (usual advice is to limit it to one)
* Photos where you're smiling or engaged in an activity

Tips on photo composition and selection:

1. Ensure your photos are well-lit.
2. Keep backgrounds simple and uncluttered to keep the focus on you
3. Include both close-ups and full-body
4. Experiment with different angles
5. Get photos of you while you’re doing something
6. Avoid group photos where it's unclear who you are

### **Tailor Your Opening Messages**

First message is arguably the most important step in establishing a good connection with someone. When crafting opening messages start by mentioning something specific from the person's profile that caught your eye. This shows that you’ve taken the time to read their profile and are genuinely interested in getting to know them.

Here are some examples of opening messages with high response rates:

* "If you could travel anywhere tomorrow, where would you go?"
* "Hey (Name), I noticed you’re fluent in Spanish and French. Do you have any book or movie recommendations in either language?"
* "You seem like someone who enjoys a good adventure. What's your next big plan?"

### **Focus on Building a Connection**

Whether you are a straight man looking for the woman of your life, or a gay man looking for the man of your dreams, your focus when building an emotional connection should be on the personality of the other person more than on their physical attributes. That’s why conversations that go deeper into interests, hobbies, values, and life goals create stronger bonds.

Over time, while in a relationship you’ll be more attracted to other characteristics than physical looks.

Here are a couple of conversation topics that you can use:

* Favorite childhood memories
* Personal goals and aspirations
* Thoughts on current events or books
* Travel experiences and dream destinations
* Shared hobbies or new activities

### **Utilize Tinder Features Strategically**

Tinder offers several features that can up your visibility and improve match rates. Those are Super Like, Boost, and Tinder Gold/Plus.

Super Like will make your profile prioritized for the person you’ve sent the like to. Tinder Boost places your profile at the top of the stack for 30 minutes. Tinder Gold/Plus are subscription models that unlock additional features like seeing who has liked you and unlimited swipes.

Strategy for timing and frequency of feature use:

* **Use Super Likes sparingly:** Target profiles you are particularly interested in.
* **Schedule Boosts for peak times:** Evenings and weekends often have more active users.
* **Leverage Tinder Gold/Plus:** Use these features to refine your matches and improve efficiency.

## **Is Tinder Implementing a Height Setting?**

As of now, Tinder has not introduced a height setting or verification feature as part of its platform. Previous mentions of height verification come from the 2019 April Fool's Day prank, but in the same prank, it was indicated that Tinder does not seriously plan to implement such a feature.

If Tinder were to implement a height setting feature, it could have several implications for users, including

* Increased transparency
* Potential discrimination
* Increased filtering
* Reinforcement of superficial criteria

## **Key Takeaways**

From this article we’ve learned the following:

* Height can most certainly impact match and swipe rates, but it’s not the only factor
* Confidence and personality, most notably humor often outweigh physical attributes like height
* Focusing on other qualities that you possess can lead to good results while online dating
* Post good pictures to your profile, write a[<u>strong bio</u>](https://thematchartist.com/tinder/sigma-male-bio), and once you connect with someone focus on building a strong connection with them
* If you have options to do so, you can use Tinder’s additional features like: Super Like, Boost, and Tinder Plus/Gold/Platinum for better visibility of your profile

If you are a short guy and you want to optimize your Tinder Profile, here’s what you can do:

1. Emphasize personality and interests in your bio.
2. Use high-quality photos that highlight your best features.
3. Craft interesting opening messages to start conversations.
4. Leverage Tinder features to increase your profile's visibility.
5. Focus on building emotional connections rather than just physical attraction.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **How Do You List Your Height on Tinder?**

To list your height on Tinder first open your profile and click "Edit Info." Then scroll down to the "About Me" section. There, you can add your height in a witty way, for example, "5'7" but standing tall."

### **Why is Height Important on Tinder?**

Height is often perceived as important due to societal norms and personal preferences. Research indicates that height can be a critical factor, particularly for men, in attracting potential partners on online dating apps. Some users, both male and female, strongly associate height with attractiveness. This is further propelled by mainstream media.

### **What is the Most Swiped Height on Tinder?**

There are no statistics directly from Tinder that tell us what is the most desirable height on the app. There is however a [study from 2005.](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/What-Makes-You-Click%3A-An-Empirical-Analysis-of-%E2%81%84-Hitsch-Horta%C3%A7su/c9eb6443b007a655105189c2decd6d598f5bbe2d) that showed that men above the height of 6'2" get 60% more messages than the ones that are 5'7" to 5'8" tall. With the rise of the term “short king” online discourse has changed slightly, but an educated guess on most swiped height would still probably be around 6 feet.
