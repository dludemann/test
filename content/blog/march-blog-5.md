## **How to Tell If a Dating App is Unsafe**

There is a lot of research one has to do to find the dating app that suits them the most. From reviews and membership fees to safety and privacy there’s a lot one has to think about. Safety should be a priority, even more if you are older, or have special needs. For example,[<u>autism dating sites</u>](https://thematchartist.com/blog/autism-dating-sites) put the priority on creating the safest possible environment for their users.

Now, there are several red flags that can indicate that a dating app might not be safe and those are:

* Lack of user verification processes
* Poor or nonexistent privacy settings
* History of security breaches
* Unresolved bugs and glitches
* Selling user data to third parties

### **History of Security Issues**

Well-known security breaches:

* Breach of personal data on Tinder (2018)
* A vulnerability that exposed the locations of users at Grindr (2018)
* Data breach at Coffee Meets Bafel (2019)
* Bug that exposed personal information on Bumble (2020)
* Data leak at MeetMindful (2021)

Security issues are bad for every user on the platform. They can lead to unauthorized access to personal information, identity theft, and financial loss. Users should always stay informed about the security history of dating apps to make safer choices.

### **Unchecked Bugs**

Bugs in dating apps can expose vulnerabilities that compromise user safety and privacy. A bug might expose personal information, such as location data or private messages, to other users or unauthorized third parties. These vulnerabilities can also lead to harassment, unauthorized access, and other security risks.

Tips for users that encounter bugs:

* Report any bugs to the app's support team
* Don’t share personal information on the platform until the bug is resolved
* Review and adjust app permissions on your device
* Regularly update the app to the latest version
* Keep an eye on your email and social media accounts

### **Selling Your Data to Third Parties**

It’s an open secret that almost every single online company is selling, or is willing to sell its users’ information. While this information, could lead them to developing better systems, there is much pushback on the collection of this data. Selling user data to third parties can lead to privacy invasions and misuse of personal information.

Here are some signs that your data might be sold:

* Targeted Ads
* Unsolicited emails or messages
* Frequent privacy policy changes
* Lack of transparency
* Previous history of data breaches

## **Tips for Safe Online Dating**

For safe and enjoyable online dating, you should remember to follow common sense and prioritize your safety over everything else. Start by looking at which safety features different apps offer. Tinder and Grindr will offer some, while[<u>Coffee Meets Bagel and Hinge</u>](https://thematchartist.com/coffee-meets-bagel/coffee-meets-bagel-vs-hinge) will offer others. When getting to know someone, take your time before agreeing to meet in person, and when you do always choose to meet in a public place.

Don’t forget to stay vigilant and protective of your personal information. Here’s how to do that:

* Avoid sharing sensitive information early
* Consider making your email different from your main one just for online dating
* Try to keep the conversation on the platform
* Be wary of sob stories
* Always verify other person’s identity
* Be cautious of what you post online

### **Choose a Dating App with Identity Verification Features**

Choosing to use apps with identity verification features helps ensure that profiles are authentic, reducing the risk of encountering fake profiles and scams. Also, verified profiles can possibly deter abusive behavior, as users are held accountable for their actions because they know their real profiles are tied to the account.

Apps that offer robust verification features:

* Eharmony
* Coffee Meets Bagel
* Tinder
* Bumble
* Hinge

### **Secure Your Account and Dating Profile**

Here’s how to create a strong password:

* Use a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters
* Avoid using easily guessable information such as birthdays or common words
* Do not use names or words that can be found in the dictionary
* Use a password manager to generate and store passwords
* Don’t reuse the same password

Additionally, to further protect your information:

* Use two-factor authentication (2FA)
* Avoid sharing personal information
* Regularly update your password and security settings

As time goes on, security threats evolve, and dating apps have to frequently update their security protocols. By occasionally checking your security settings, you can make sure that your account benefits from the latest protections offered by the app.

### **Inspect Dating Profiles**

Carefully examine profiles for authenticity:

* Look for complete profiles with detailed information
* Check for a variety of photos that appear genuine
* Verify if the profile is linked to other social media accounts

Profiles with minimal information or just one photo can be red flags, as they may indicate a lack of genuine interest or effort. At the same time, pay attention to profiles with photos that seem too good to be true, as they could be stock images.

Be vary of matches that try to move the conversation into personal or financial matters too quickly, as well as the ones that are always looking for an excuse not to share a video or new picture of themselves.

### **Don’t Share Sensitive Content**

Sharing sensitive content can lead to identity theft, blackmail, and cyberbullying. Leaked private information can have long-lasting effects on one’s life, causing emotional distress and reputational damage.

Here’s what you should share, and what you should keep private:

* Basic interests and hobbies are okay to share
* General information about what you do or study is also okay
* If you are comfortable sharing other social media accounts you should do it
* Exact address and full name should not be shared
* Same goes for bank details and salary
* Don’t share photos and intimate details about your life until you trust the other person

## **Key Takeaways**

In this article we’ve learned:

* Online dating apps like Hinge, Tinder, Bumble, Grindr, Match, and others take the security and privacy of their users very seriously
* Most of them possess some sort of profile and photo verifications, as well as data encryption, and report and block features
* Before choosing one of the apps, one should familiarize with which safety features they have, if they had a history of breaches, and any potential bugs or vulnerabilities
* To be safe while online dating, one should make a strong password, not share overly personal information lightly, and verify who they are chatting with

Taking proactive steps for safe online dating is very important. By choosing secure platforms and being careful with who you interact with, you can enjoy a safer and more positive dating experience.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **Is Online Dating Safe or Risky?**

Any interaction online carries some risk with it. While looking for love online, you do have a chance of encountering fake profiles and scammers, as well as experience harassment in different forms.

However, that doesn’t mean that there aren’t ways to minimize these things. Choosing well-known and reputable dating apps is probably the first thing you should do. They usually have good safety features that will protect you in your interactions. But, you should not forget to use common sense and not share sensitive information.

### **Is Hinge for Hookups or Relationships?**

Hinge markets itself as the app “designed to be deleted,” aka a relationships app, rather than an app for hookups. Of course, that doesn’t mean that you won’t run into some people who only want quick fun.

Many users on different forums report successful long-term relationships initiated on Hinge. Another survey that Hinge did also showed that most of their users are looking for serious connections.

### **Should I Join Tinder or Bumble?**

This decision really comes down to what you prefer or looking for. Tinder is still the biggest online dating app, but they do have the stigma (rightfully) for being a hookup app. It has a swipe-based interface, where anybody can make the first move if they like someone.

On the other hand, Bumble has a unique approach where women are the ones to make the first move. Its user base is slightly older than Tinder’s, and thus has a better environment for finding long-term relationships.

If security is your concern, then you shouldn’t worry too much as both apps offer many safety and privacy features to keep your online dating life enjoyable.
