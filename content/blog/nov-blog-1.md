## What is Coffee Meets Bagel?

Coffee Meets Bagel is a dating app founded in 2012 by sisters Arum, Soo, and Dawoon Kang. Their goal is to help users find long-term relationships and avoid the endless swiping that comes with most dating apps.

Coffee Meets Bagel differs from other dating apps. This new player in the dating app scene helps anyone and everyone form genuine connections and find a long-term partner.

## How Does Coffee Meets Bagel Work?

Coffee Meets Bagel is unique and led by women who believe that men and women date differently. Women tend to be more selective, while men prefer to see a wide range of potential partners.

For this reason, the Coffee Meets Bagel app works slightly differently for men and women.

### How Does Coffee Meets Bagel Work for Females?

Each day at noon, the Coffee Meets Bagel matches will be released. Women on the app view a curated list of six ‘bagels’ (potential matches). They can then decide whether or not they are interested.

### How Does Coffee Meets Bagel Work for Guys?

Men on the Coffee Meets Bagel app view a wider pool of potential matches - twenty-one to be exact. They will then be able to browse these potential matches and decide who they are most interested in.

## Who is Coffee Meets Bagel for?

Coffee Meets Bagel is an alternative to all the other dating apps. Unlike apps like Bumble or Tinder, Coffee Meet Bagel isn’t concerned with casual flings. Coffee Meets Bagel is for those looking for a long-term, committed relationship.

Coffee Meets Bagel is for meeting people, getting to know each other, and hopefully entering a serious relationship.

## How do You Create a Coffee Meets Bagel Account?

So, interested in trying Coffee Meets Bagel out? You’ll want to know how to set up an account.

### Profile Set Up

The profile setup process for Coffee Meets Bagel is straightforward. The first thing you’ll need to do is install the app on your device.

You can do this by searching for it on the App Store and hitting ‘download.’ From here, the Coffee Meets Bagel app will provide instructions to help you set up your profile.

### Linking to Social Media Accounts

You’ll want to link your social media accounts when setting up your profile. Our findings show that people on dating apps want to see your personality and presence outside the app.

Linking your social media accounts helps others get to know you. It also goes a long way to assure users you’re not a catfish.

### Verification Process

Coffee Meets Bagel requires you to complete a verification process before your profile is live. The verification process confirms that you are a real person, not a bot or catfish. This process also helps later on down the line to protect the security of your account.

So you’ve made your account? Now’s the fun part – [completing your profile](https://thematchartist.com/coffee-meets-bagel/coffee-meets-bagel-profile-examples).

Drawing from our experience, a user with a lackluster profile will likely lower their chance of finding a match. Ensure you put your best foot forward when creating your Coffee Meets Bagel profile!

### Selecting Photos for Your Profile

Profile photos are almost entirely responsible for the first impression that Coffee Meets Bagel users will get of you. As such, you want to ensure you upload clear and flattering images of yourself. Select a few photos you look good in and show off your personality to catch the eye of potential matches!

### Filling Out Prompts

The next thing that Coffee Meets Bagel will need is information about who you are. The app will provide you with various prompts to fill out to gather essential details about you.

What are your likes and dislikes? Your interests and education? What do you look for in a relationship - are you swept off your feet by flowers or food?

### Icebreakers

One great feature that Coffee Meets Bagel offers is a section on your profile for an icebreaker. Icebreakers help ensure none of your chats have to start with the awkward exchange of ‘hello’ and ‘hi.’

Try filling out the icebreaker section with a funny joke or interesting question. Make sure whatever you put in is relevant to you and your personality. That way, your conversations are sure to flow.

## Activity Report & Potential Matches

So you’ve set up your profile. It’s time to get into the inner workings of the app.

Based on our firsthand experience, you'll need to understand two key aspects of the app: activity reports and potential matches. Let’s check out how these two services function within the app.

### How the Activity Report Works

The ‘activity report’ provides general information about a person and how they use the app. This report helps determine how likely they are to engage with you.

Someone's activity report may show that they respond to 80% of their matches and reply to chats within two hours. Someone else’s activity report might show an engagement rate of 30% and 10+ hours to respond to chats.

You are far more likely to form a connection with the first person. The days of wasting time on users who never get back to you are over. However, remember that this feature is only available through the app's premium version.

### Generating Potential Matches

Potential matches are generated slightly differently for men and women.

Twenty-one bagels, or potential matches, will be provided for men. Men can then select which bagels they are interested in. The initial list of bagels is curated for them by the app using information gathered by the app’s algorithm.

Women will then receive their six bagels. These bagels are for men who have already indicated an interest in them. A woman liking a ‘bagel’ forms a match.

### Quality Over Quantity

It may seem like both twenty-one and six are relatively low numbers regarding potential dating app matches. It might seem exceptionally slim compared to the many potential matches on other dating apps. However, Coffee Meets Bagel has implemented these limits for a particular reason.

The Coffee Meets Bagel team believes focusing on quality over quantity is essential. Focusing on a select handful of users you will likely be compatible with can streamline the dating app experience. This more considered method can help you find someone you genuinely connect with.

## Special Features of Coffee Meets Bagel

A few special features of the Coffee Meets Bagel dating app set it apart. We’re here to give you a rundown of the unique features of this app and how to use them.

### App Currency: "Bagels" and "Coffee"

So, where exactly does the ‘coffee’ and ‘bagel’ from the app's name come into play? You know by now that potential matches are dubbed bagels. So, it is only fitting that the in-app currency is called ‘beans,’ modeled after coffee beans.

These in-app beans can be used for all sorts of things. You can use beans to reopen expired conversations to send more messages. Or, you can purchase more bagels in a day - unlocking more potential matches.

### Extra Bagels: Discover & Take

Beans can buy you more curated potential matches that will likely fit you well. However, there is another way to get more of these matches.

The ‘discover’ page on the app is full of bagels that have not been selected for you by the algorithm. These bagels are also available for you to pursue.

### Heart Icon: A Different Way to Like Someone

Coffee Meets Bagel uses a similar ‘liking’ format to many forms of social media. You tap a heart icon when you are interested in someone.

The difference with Coffee Meets Bagel? There is an expiration date - as is the case with real bagels! Once presented with a potential match, you have 24 hours to like or pass.

## How to Increase Your Matches on Coffee Meets Bagel

Looking for ways to [increase your number of matches on Coffee Meets Bagel?](https://thematchartist.com/coffee-meets-bagel/no-matches-on-coffee-meets-bagel) You’ve come to the right place. There are a few options to increase how many matches you receive on this app.

The first method is [utilizing the Discover page](https://thematchartist.com/coffee-meets-bagel/coffee-meets-bagel-discover). The potential matches displayed on this page have not been curated based on suitability. However, it is still worth checking out the profiles in this section.

Your other option is to use the in-app beans to purchase more bagels - potential matches - per day. You can buy these beans with money or receive some for free by inviting friends to the app. Just be sure you respond within 24 hours to avoid wasting potential matches!

## How to Find Matches on Coffee Meets Bagel

The best part about Coffee Meets Bagel is that you won’t have to hunt for matches. At noon every day, the app will present you with your potential matches. Thanks to the algorithm, the potential matches you are present with will likely match your preferences.

## How Much Does Coffee Meets Bagel Cost?

Coffee Meets Bagel can be used entirely for free. However, you can purchase a premium Coffee Meets Bagel subscription to unlock the app's special features. A premium subscription offers features such as increased potential matches and access to activity reports.

## Key Takeaways

Looking for genuine commitment love on standard typical dating apps can be endlessly frustrating. These platforms are often overrun with people wanting casual flings or people just there to waste time!

Coffee Meets Bagel aims to find a compatible partner with whom you will have a strong connection. And that’s without wasting precious hours over people who were never going to work.

They do this by prioritizing quality over quantity and matching up users who are most likely to be compatible. A rewarding experience is enabled by curated lists of bagels and carefully refined in-app features.
