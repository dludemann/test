## **Secrets to Getting Serious Relationships on Tinder**

To increase your chances of finding love on Tinder one needs a well-crafted profile. Creating a good profile is hard though, so here are some tips on how to go about it:

### **Showcase Your Unique Personality**

The best way to showcase your personality is to write down your interests. For example hobbies: like cooking, hiking, running, photography, cycling, playing football, etc.

You can also note down some of the more quirky and interesting parts of your personality like:

* Can sing every Daft Punk song
* Collects vintage vinyl records

### **Post High-quality Pictures**

Two very important aspects you should keep in mind when taking photos for Tinder are:

* **Lighting:** Great lighting can really elevate an image, highlight what the image makers want to say, and transform the photograph from mere documentation to a crafted piece of art
* **Framing:** Shows where the viewer should be focusing their attention and draws them away from any distracting elements of the photograph

You should post a mix of different shots to reflect your lifestyle better:

1. Close-up selfies
2. Full-body images

### **Choose Photos That Stimulate Conversation**

Photos of you doing things are the best conversation starters. Those can be:

* travel photos
* photos of you playing with your pet
* photos of you playing a sport

You should avoid being cliched. There are thousands of people on Tinder, and you want to stand out with your photos. So try to avoid:

* Mirror selfies
* Showing only looks and not a style
* Group photos
* Taking photos in the same location

### **Be More Emotional and Less Factual**

Instead of listing facts about yourself, infuse your bio with emotion and authenticity. Share personal anecdotes or express your desires and intentions openly to create a deeper connection with potential matches.

<table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Factual statements</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Emotional statements</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>I enjoy reading books.</p></td><td><p>There's nothing like getting lost in a good book and feeling the characters come to life.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>I'm seeking a partner who shares similar values and interests.</p></td><td><p>I'm looking for someone who makes my heart skip a beat.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>I enjoy hiking in my free time and love exploring the outdoors.</p></td><td><p>I'm passionate about hiking and exploring nature's beauty.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

### **Ask the Right Questions**

To break the ice and encourage interaction with potential matches ask questions in your bio that show your desire to know someone on a deeper level. Here are some examples:

1. What's your idea of a perfect weekend getaway?
2. What's the most memorable adventure or experience you've had so far?
3. Describe a place that feels like home to you, even if it's not where you currently live.

Of course, you should be careful about what you ask about in the early stages. Keep some of these things in mind:

* Start with light and casual topics
* Don't pry into someone's personal life too quickly
* Pay attention to their responses and adjust your questions accordingly
* Focus on getting to know their interests, aspirations, and worldview first

### **Have Realistic Expectations**

As with everything in life, love is the same - you have to be patient. Patience allows us to navigate through uncertainties and setbacks. Open-mindedness is also important when looking for a partner. Nobody will have every single quality you are looking for, and being open-minded will allow you to fall in love with what they have.

To better manage expectations without lowering standards:

* Focus on compatibility
* Be realistic
* Communicate effectively
* Understand yourself first, before trying to understand others
* Don’t compromise your standards while identifiying what you want in someone
* Prioritize mutual respect

### **Consider Tone and Language**

Pay attention to the tone and language you use in your bio. Aim to be positive and original, but also try to avoid overly vulgar or disrespectful language. Sometimes it’s okay to be a bit more open (for example when you just want to hookup) but don’t go over the top. The same goes for humor. It’s okay to be a bit negative, but don’t go overboard with self-deprecating humor.

<table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Phrases to Use</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Phrases to Avoid</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>What's your go-to karaoke song? Mine's 'Bohemian Rhapsody'.</p></td><td><p>If you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Hiking enthusiast who's happiest with a backpack and trail mix.</p></td><td><p>Sick of people who can't hold a decent conversation.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Would you rather be able to talk to animals, or be fluent in all languages?</p></td><td><p>Tired of being ghosted. Only swipe right if you're serious.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

### **Reflect on Your Ideal Match**

It's important to be clear about what you're looking for and you can do that by writing down the qualities that you want in someone. But, remember to:

* Be realistic about what you expect
* Be Honest
* Focus on positives, not negatives
* Be open-minded
* Be confident, but not arrogant

What you should avoid is making very specific lists. Providing too much detail may make you look desperate and needy. People may also see the list and just not bother with it, thinking that your standards are way too high.

## **Key Takeaways**

* You can definitely find a person for a serious relationship on Tinder, but for that, you need to set your profile in a way that will garner attention
* To craft a good profile you need to write down a good, authentic, and interesting bio, while also providing high-quality photos that showcase your life
* You also need to be respectful when conversing with others and have realistic expectations about them
* To get connected with better-suited people you should write down a list of things that you want in a person, but that list shouldn’t be overly specific
