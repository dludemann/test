## What is Coffee Meets Bagel?

[Coffee Meets Bagel](https://coffeemeetsbagel.com/) advertises itself as an app for ‘serious daters’, unlike Tinder which is catered more to casual dating. It’s designed to provide people looking for love with a curated dating experience. It provides users with potential matches known as ‘bagels’ and focuses on attracting others who are looking for a long-term [partner rather than just a hookup](https://www.forbes.com/health/dating/coffee-meets-bagel-review/).

### How Does Coffee Meets Bagel Work?

Coffee Meets Bagel works with an algorithm, just like other dating apps - users are offered several potential matches each day based on factors like their preferences, location, and activity.

App users can then review these profiles and decide whether to like or pass on them. If both parties like each other’s profiles, it’s a match, and they can start a conversation. This approach to matches means a user reflects on personal dating criteria and interests to get matches that closely align with their interests.

## Why Are You Getting Zero Matches on Coffee Meets Bagel?

Sometimes a CMB user experiences a lack of matches or encounters difficulty in finding suitable partners. This is usually down to how they’re using the app - either a lack of effort on their profile or narrow preference settings. When a user changes their approach to using the app, they’ll usually find an increase in matches.

### Incomplete or Unappealing Profile

This is the big one - an incomplete profile portrays you as disinterested and lazy. After all, if you can’t be bothered creating a good dating app profile, are you really going to be a good partner?

We strongly advise that a user who is struggling to improve profile quality for better visibility and update personal information and preferences. You need your profile to give an idea of who you are and what you’re looking for in a partner in order to attract matches.

This may mean a user modifies profile details to attract more matches or reevaluates expectations and preferences in dating.

### Inconsistent App Usage

Most dating apps and social media algorithms [reward engagement](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2022/10/14/a-guide-to-social-media-algorithms-and-seo/) and regular use. When anyone regularly engages with the app and updates personal information and preferences frequently, the app is more likely to reward you with potential matches.

### Narrowed Preferences and Filters

We get it - it’s important to have standards and know what you’re looking for. However, it might be worth checking if your preferences are *too* narrow, as this can limit the pool of people you can match with.

When a user expands search criteria to include more options and reviews and updates matchmaking preferences, they open themselves up to more potential matches.

### Profile Visibility and Engagement

It might not seem fair, but many online dating apps reward users who purchase premium subscription packages. Using [CMB premium](https://thematchartist.com/coffee-meets-bagel/coffee-meets-bagel-premium) enhances visibility through in-app boosts - in fact, users who activate a [‘Boost’](https://thematchartist.com/coffee-meets-bagel/coffee-meets-bagel-boost) get up to 5x as many matches during the boost period! You can purchase an extra Boost by using CMB ‘beans’ - they’re the currency that is used on the app.

## Common Factors Contributing to No Matches on Coffee Meets Bagel

Getting no matches on CMB is disappointing, but understanding why is the key to fixing the problem. With causes ranging from your settings to the quality of your dating profile, when a user investigates reasons behind the lack of matches and understands the algorithm's role in matchmaking, they’re far more likely to have success.

### Age & Location

Your age or location can have an impact on the number of matches you get. Users who live in areas with small populations can struggle to find matches in their age range using CMB.

In this case, you might benefit from [expanding your location](https://coffeemeetsbagel.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020974613-How-do-I-edit-my-location-#:~:text=Tap%20on%20Edit%20in%20the,Tap%20Done%20when%20finished.) to include the nearest large center if you’re open to a long-distance relationship. Users have also noticed that CMB [skews older](https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeemeetsbagel/comments/nrx3yi/age_range/) when it comes to the age of users, so if you’re in your early 20s you might benefit from switching to a dating app that is more popular with your demographic.

### Dating Profile Quality

A high-quality profile is one of the easiest and best changes you can make to attract ‘bagels’. If your profile is not properly filled out or has only one or two photos, users are far less likely to like your profile. Make sure you have plenty of information about yourself, answer some prompts, and ensure your photos are high quality and up to date.

If you’re struggling with the photos you have, consider using a professional photography service like The Match Artist so that your profile really stands out! Even if you think your profile looks ok, a successful dater always considers revising profile photos and descriptions to increase success.

### Inactive or Unresponsive Users

Sadly, there’s not much you can do about this one! Some users are just inactive and unresponsive - this is more likely if you live in an area with a smaller population so there are fewer active users overall. Focus on the things you can change, like improving your profile and ensuring you’re using the app at [peak times](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/relationships/article-11305525/The-best-time-use-Tinder-Bumble-Hinge-matches.html).

### Low Match Rates

There are a few reasons for low match rates, but one is that your preferences are too strict. We advise that a user analyzes preferences for potential mismatches to ensure you are not excluding matches you might be interested in. When a user broadens the scope of the search to increase match chances, they may find themselves pleasantly surprised!

### Limited Matches Per Day

With Coffee Meets Bagel, all users receive a [limited number](https://healthyframework.com/coffee-meets-bagel-review/) of ‘bagels’ every day. These are your potential matches, and you can decide whether or not to like them or pass on them.

While this limited approach may seem like it reduces your chances of finding someone, it’s actually a great method of ensuring you match with people you have something in common with. If you find you’re not getting many daily matches, the answer could lie in updating your personal information and preferences.

## How to Improve Your Dating Profile Quality

In our experience, improving the quality of your dating profile is the single most important thing you can do to get more matches on dating apps. A good profile is a great way to increase your chances of finding a good match - here’s how to do it:

### Pick an Interesting Profile Picture and Bio Text

First impressions matter. Make sure you choose a picture that shows what you really look like, while still being flattering. If you’re struggling to get a good photo, try using a service like The Match Artist - their photographers use facial expression coaching to ensure you look your absolute best.

The bio text is another essential, and when a user customizes a profile to align with interests it makes them more appealing to potential matches. Make sure you fill out your icebreakers and include details about yourself, such as your job, hobbies, and interests.

### Make Sure Your Profile is Up to Date

Ensure your profile is up to date and reflects your current interests. This not only ensures your preferences are correct and accurate, it helps the app’s algorithm find the right potential matches for your interests.

### Increase Your Visibility by Using Premium Features & Preferences

Try investing in CMB premium or paying for a profile Boost to improve your visibility. This can vastly increase the number of eyes that see your profile, thus improving your chance of matches. A successful user navigates through the app to understand features so they can make the most of everything that’s on offer.

### Use Monthly Profile Boosts

With some CMB plans you get a [monthly profile boost](https://coffeemeetsbagel.medium.com/double-the-matches-with-cmb-premium-60a83c7146fc) which you can activate whenever you want. Use this boost to ensure you get more views and potentially more likes and matches.

### Post High-Quality Dating Photographs

When it comes to dating photographs, [the research is clear](https://medium.com/hello-love/the-science-behind-the-perfect-online-dating-profile-picture-36b5619c0f2)\- the type of photo really matters! Avoid selfies, too many group pics with your friends, and tacky shirtless pictures. Ideally, you should upload high-quality images that showcase your personality. Using a professional photography service like The Match Artist is a great way to take this to the next level and ensure your profile pics truly stand out from the crowd.

## How to Improve Your Match Opportunities

So, what are some concrete actions you can take to improve your match opportunities? From changing your preferences to engaging with different features to please the algorithm, small changes can end up making a big difference.

### Adjusting Preferences and Filters

We; 've already gone over how restrictive filters and preferences can limit your matches. We really can’t stress this enough - be open-minded when you set your preferences. Changing your approach often requires adjustments in profile settings. After all, what if that perfect guy or girl is just one year older or younger than your filters, and you don’t get to meet them because your criteria are too strict?

### Regularly Using the App to Increase Visibility

Use the app, particularly at busy times. This is the best way to boost your visibility among everyone using the app. A savvy user also optimizes the use of in-app features and tools like Boosts in order to raise their chances of getting matches and likes.

### Participating in Features Like Discover and Suggested

On CMB, the [Suggested](https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeemeetsbagel/comments/agy4ld/opinions_on_suggested_vs_discover/) feature highlights potential matches that fit within your preferences, while the Discover feature has suggestions that fall outside of your preferences. Engaging with both categories is a great way to expand your range and be start swiping with more men and women who could be potential matches.

A successful user explores different aspects of the app for optimization, and that includes making use of recommendations in both Discover *and* Suggested. The Discover area may show users who are outside of your filtered demographics, but who you may still have compatibility with - remember to be open-minded!

## How to Get More Likes on Coffee Meets Bagel

Getting more likes on CMB can largely be summed up by the following - improve your profile, expand your preferences, and engage with the algorithm. But how do you properly view the people who have liked your profile? And what if the likes are not showing up?

### What should you do if your likes are not displaying correctly?

While there are limitations on the number of likes you can see when using the free membership, if you upgrade to Premium you should be able to see all of your CMB [likes](https://thematchartist.com/coffee-meets-bagel/how-to-see-likes-on-coffee-meets-bagel). [Some users](https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeemeetsbagel/comments/vuwrn4/cant_see_likes_even_after_premium_membership/) report that the Android version of the app is glitchy when it comes to displaying likes, so you could try contacting the [CMB support](https://coffeemeetsbagel.zendesk.com/hc/en-us) team and giving feedback on the issue you’re having.

## Why Are You Not Getting Any Replies on Coffee Meets Bagel?

Picture this - you’ve made changes to your profile, you’ve widened your preferences and you’ve got a bit more matches. So why are you not getting replies? Unfortunately, a lack of replies is an issue on all dating apps - some people just stop engaging with the app or might be too busy to reply.

### Why are Your Chats Disappearing?

If your chat disappears, there’s usually [one main reason](https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeemeetsbagel/comments/t2zkiz/conversation_disappeared_from_chat/): the person you were messaging with has unmatched or blocked you.

While this may be due to something you said, in many cases it has nothing to do with you - perhaps the user decided to be exclusive with someone else, or perhaps they decided to give up on online dating. The best thing to do is move on to one of your matches who is responding to your messages!

If this keeps happening, we recommend the user experiment with different types of interactions or seek advice or tips for enhancing match potential.
