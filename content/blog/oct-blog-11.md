# Can You Send Pictures on Hinge?

Dating apps have taken the world by storm over the last few years, with more and more people finding love online.

One of the most popular of those apps? Hinge.

One of the most unique features dating apps have brought to the online romance environment? Sending photos to those you interact with!

So, can you send pictures on Hinge? This detailed guide will explore attaching photos to a Hinge profile and conversations. Moreover, we’ll detail how to enhance the Hinge experience with some workarounds and cover frequently asked questions.

You could be a dating app natural. You could need some [dating tips and the answers to finding a real relationship online](https://thematchartist.com/blog/how-to-flirt-with-girls-online). Either way, this is the guide for you.

Let’s get into it!

## What is Hinge?

[Hinge](https://hinge.co/) is a dating app created in 2012, with an app release in 2013. Since then, Hinge has quickly become [one of the more influential players in online dating.](https://www.forbes.com/health/dating/best-dating-apps/)

Hinge’s mission is to prioritize authenticity, courage, and empathy in the dating space as well as in their business conduct. Hinge is a refreshing choice compared to the more commercialized nature of other apps, such as Tinder.

Hinge focuses on meaningful interactions. In fact, you need to actually send messages to get matches rather than simply swiping left or right.

## Can You Send Pictures on Hinge?

So, how does Hinge handle direct photo sharing in chats? Can you capture your favorite moments of the day and send them through? Can you receive visual updates from those you’re messaging with?

The short answer is no. Unlike [other apps like Tinder](https://thematchartist.com/tinder/can-you-send-photos-on-tinder) and [Bumble](https://thematchartist.com/bumble/can-you-send-photos-on-bumble), Hinge doesn’t allow you to send images through the app’s messaging service. Not even with a paid membership!

“But, my selfies! My holiday photos!” We hear your cries!

Have no fear. You’ll still be able to embarrass yourself with pictures of you as a kid. Remember that time you tried to fit a toy car in your ear?

There are a range of workarounds we can explore. These methods will ensure a successful image transfer to your potential partner. Read on to discover more!

## Why Does Hinge Not Allow Sending Pictures in Chat?

So, why doesn’t Hinge allow direct photo sharing like some other dating apps?

The company doesn’t have an explicit public rationale. However, it’s safe to assume that this is a design feature to protect end users of the app.

Most images you’ll want to send to someone you’re looking for a relationship with are fairly innocent. However, certain bad actors might misuse the power of images for evil.

Hinge is likely not incentivized to add image messaging functionality, either. After all, Hinge’s focus is on long-term relationship creation. Hinge wants to match you with the love of your life!

Sending a risque Snapchat with “you up?” underneath it might be the norm in other, more transiently orientated dating apps. However, Hinge has done its best to create a culture removed from this mentality. What's more, they have no interest in undoing that progress.

## 3 Workarounds to Send Pictures on Hinge

### Upload to an Online Image Storage Website and Share Link

Can users link external platforms like Instagram to showcase more photos on Hinge? The answer is yes!

Hinge allows you to send links in chat. These links can be for Dropbox, a Google Drive, an Instagram profile, or any other (legitimate) media-sharing website.

If you’re looking for the perfect picture to send, you have as many options as there are linkable platforms! Whoever you’re talking to should be able to access any image easily. Importantly, they can access an image regardless of whether or not you can embed it in the chat.

### Move Conversation to a Different Social Media App

Speaking of social media, if things are going well on Hinge, consider moving to another platform! That way, you can send, open, and save images as you like.

Of course, you probably won’t want to do this immediately. It’s risky to leave the safety of Hinge’s moderation tools to an unprotected platform with someone you don’t trust yet.

Instead, wait for a rapport to build throughout your conversation. Ensure that their personality is a good fit and that you have a similar sense of humor. Moreover, ensure they are somebody you’d be interested in taking the next step with.

If you don’t have another form of social media, you can always go old-fashioned and hand over your phone number. If you don’t want to be stung with texting fees, another idea is to use WhatsApp to communicate. Whatsapp allows you to use your existing phone number without charging you for texts.

### Upload Image to Your Hinge Profile

As a last resort - or if your profile looks a little thin - you can upload images to your Hinge profile. There are probably better plans for sharing a particular conversational tidbit. But it could be a great choice if it doubles as a nice pic of yourself!

Let’s chat a bit more in detail about profile photos. How can you best select and adjust them, and how will others view them?

#### Are there any features on Hinge to enhance or edit photos before uploading?

Hinge provides [some limited ability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu_pmJXncVs) to edit your photos when uploading them. This feature primarily focuses on being able to zoom and crop your photos.

However, you’re probably looking for in-depth editing features, such as the ability to filter, rotate, and preview your edited pictures. If this is the case, you’re probably better off editing in a separate app beforehand.

#### What’s the process for updating or changing profile photos on Hinge?

While you can’t simply delete a photo, [you can easily replace one or more](https://hingeapp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034066333-How-do-I-delete-photos-from-my-profile-). Profile customization at its best!

You'll see your current photos displayed by tapping the photo icon on the top right of the navigation bar. Simply tap the “x” on the top right of any photo to replace it. You can browse for photos from your phone or import some from other social media apps.

#### Are there any size or format restrictions for photos on Hinge?

Hinge photos [display as squares](https://www.reddit.com/r/hingeapp/comments/rrdjym/what_size_photos_to_use_so_i_get_the_entire_frame/)\- that is, with a 1:1 aspect ratio. This is different from typical camera aspect ratios, which are often 4:3. The 1:1 aspect ratio will also not suit any other format where one side is longer than the other.

For best results, you’ll want to crop your existing photos so they are already 1:1 before you upload them. However, Hinge can help you do this if you don’t mind potentially getting an imperfect crop/arrangement.

Hinge will support most major image file formats (such as jpg and jpeg). However, you might have more trouble with unusual formats like SVGs. If another social media app, such as Instagram or Facebook, can handle it, Hinge should do fine, too.

#### How do profile photos impact match rates and interactions on Hinge?

I guarantee you’ve got at least one friend with a list of success stories as long as their arm. These stories all supposedly tie back to the profile picture to end all profile pictures.

A picture tells a thousand words - and the amount of information you immediately pick up from visual content is incredible. But does a better profile picture selection get you more likes?

Put it this way. Would you date someone who trumpets out to the world a grainy picture of themselves in a grim room? Or would you prefer someone in a well-lit environment with clear pride in who they are?

#### How does Hinge’s photo algorithm work to showcase user images?

Hinge’s algorithm [matches you with people that it thinks will be most likely to reciprocate any interest you show](https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3e3bw/how-does-the-hinge-algorithm-work).

When someone’s profile crops up on your feed, you are guided by your preferences and past interactions on the platform. However, you will also be guided by how likely they are to be interested in what you offer!

For example, the social media algorithms on sites like Instagram serve posts you will likely enjoy. But these sites aren’t focused on ensuring the original creator also likes you. Mutual interest isn’t essential for their service model.

Hinge, on the other hand, is interested in facilitating long-term relationships! A model that isn’t served just by ensuring one party is satisfied. Through a comprehensive use of user demographics and data, Hinge ensures you find the best match and, hopefully, love!

#### Can users provide feedback or suggestions related to photo features on Hinge?

Hinge doesn’t have an obvious photo feature feedback platform. However, leaving reviews on their various app store pages is an excellent way to get your voice out!

#### How does Hinge address the issue of inappropriate or misleading photos?

Hinge allows you to report any accounts that aren’t following their rules. Users can also choose to mark their profiles as authentic. This process involves a review where [an AI model compares selfies to uploaded photos.](https://www.vidaselect.com/hinge-guide/)

Before we move on, let’s address the elephant in the room. Are there any safety concerns associated with sharing photos on Hinge? How can users ensure their photos remain private on Hinge?

[Users can screenshot images](https://www.wikihow.com/Does-Hinge-Notify-Screenshots) on Hinge, meaning people can take photos off the platform and share them on secondary sites. Don’t put anything up you wouldn’t want your grandma seeing, nor a potential employer - be sensible and safe online!

Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that your photos will remain private on Hinge. As mentioned above, photos you send through other media-sharing sites are likewise not guaranteed to be kept private.

The only way to ensure that any photo you send is kept private is not to send any. However, a solid second bet is ensuring you trust the person you are talking to.

As with all social media profiles, a creep may try to find you based on the photos in your profile. This is a risk you’ll have to take if you’re aiming to put yourself out there on any dating app.

## What Photos Are Allowed On Hinge?

Of course, the natural next questions are: what types of photos are prohibited or discouraged on Hinge? And what are the guidelines for uploading photos to a Hinge profile?

Hinge’s [terms](https://hinge.co/terms) provide a complete list of requirements and restrictions for the platform, but some are particularly relevant for photos. Specifically:

* You’ll need at least one photo with your face in it.
* You shouldn’t upload anything that misrepresents you - so no overly-edited or super old photos, and nothing that isn’t really you!
* You can’t upload anything obscene, pornographic, violent, or otherwise commonly considered offensive.
* You also can’t upload anything that facilitates abuse, threats, hate speech, or similar content.

In other words, make it like a typical public social media account. After all, you’re trying to find someone who loves you for you. Make it the same face you’d present to the whole world!

## Can You Send GIFs On Hinge Chat?

Unfortunately, just like pictures, [GIFs are forbidden in a Hinge Chat.](https://dude-hack.com/can-you-send-photos-on-hinge/) Luckily, you can get around this the same way as regular images. However, you may be more constrained in your choice of image hosting platform.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can People Screenshot Pictures on Hinge?

[Yes](https://www.wikihow.com/Does-Hinge-Notify-Screenshots). You won’t receive a notification if somebody takes a screenshot, either.

### Can You Send Videos on Hinge?

While you can’t send videos through Hinge’s messaging, [you can add short videos to your profile in lieu of photos](https://www.vidaselect.com/hinge-video/).

### Can I Put Childhood Pictures on Hinge?

While Hinge has no specific restrictions on this, you may fall foul of their “accurate representation” policy. Plus, popular opinion [is divided](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineDating/comments/vnj6i7/putting_pics_of_yourself_as_a_child_on_your/) on the appropriateness of adding childhood pictures to your public dating profile. As such, we wouldn’t recommend uploading childhood photos to Hinge.
