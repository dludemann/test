## What are "Beans" on Coffee Meets Bagel?

Coffee Meets Bagel (CMB) is a popular dating app that aims to focus on quality over quantity. It’s a step away from dating apps that cater more to hookups like Bumble or Tinder - [CMB was created](https://coffeemeetsbagel.com/) by three founders who were tired of the online dating scene and wanted a change. CMB [works by sending](https://thematchartist.com/coffee-meets-bagel/how-does-coffee-meets-bagel-work) users a limited number of matches (Bagels) daily, based on an algorithm informed by their preferences, location, and activity on the app.

[Beans](https://coffeemeetsbagel.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017441574-What-are-beans) are the app's currency and can be used to access premium features on the app. Named for coffee beans, they’re a way for singles to use premium features to find each other and get dates.

### What can Beans Be Used for?

Beans can be used for several things on the app, all designed to enhance your dating journey. You can use them to:

* Unlock extra Bagels
* Send more likes in Discover
* Reopen or extend a chat
* [Turn on Read Receipts](https://www.wikihow.com/Use-Coffee-Meets-Bagel) in your chats

### Can I Earn Free Beans?

While you can purchase Beans from the Bean shop, there are ways to get [free beans](https://coffeemeetsbagel.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020785354-How-can-I-get-free-beans)as well. You can refer friends, follow CMB on social media, or sign in each day during your first week. There are also sometimes temporary offers that you can take part in to get free beans, but these are unpredictable and only come up occasionally.

### How Do I Use My Beans?

You get to choose exactly how to use your Beans, as they are yours! Here are some [suggested ways](https://coffeemeetsbagel.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020785534-What-can-beans-be-used-for) to use them:

* Discover Likes: While it's free to like your suggested bagels, if you’d like to see additional bagels outside of your Suggested tab, you can use Beans to send likes in Discover
* Extra Bagels: If we have a lot of bagels lined up for you in the Suggested tab, you may be able to use beans to see more bagels in your queue.
* Reopen or Extend a Chat: If your chat with someone has expired and you’re having regrets, you can use beans to extend it for 30 days.
* Boost: Use your Beans to Boost your profile and get more views and matches.

## How to Get CMB Beans

Getting Beans on CMB is pretty straightforward - you can either buy them or use one of the options available for getting free Beans. Here’s how to do it!

### New Profile Bonus

CMB offers new users a bonus allotment of Beans after completing their profile and using it regularly during their first week. Completing a profile includes uploading photos and filling out details - this is to ensure your profile is complete and looks as good as possible!

### Free Beans

You can earn free Beans by referring friends, following CMB on social media, and through the occasional task or challenge presented by CMB. With each successful referral that leads to a friend creating a CMB account, you’ll get free beans, so get referring!

### Subscribe To Premium

If you’re frequently using a lot of beans, CMB recommends subscribing to their [Premium](https://thematchartist.com/coffee-meets-bagel/coffee-meets-bagel-premium)service. [Premium subscribers](https://coffeemeetsbagel.medium.com/double-the-matches-with-cmb-premium-60a83c7146fc) get access to a raft of great features and often end up doubling their number of matches. You’ll also get a big discount on Beans when you get a Premium subscription.

### Buy Beans

If you prefer a more direct approach, you can simply buy Beans outright! You can do this through the CMB app, using the payment method of your choice. This gives you instant access to Beans which you can spend however you want.

## How To Spend Beans on CMB?

Spending Beans on CMB improves your dating experience as it gives you access to a raft of Premium features and broadens your options.

### Unlock More Bagels

You can use your Beans to unlock more Bagels from the [Discover](https://thematchartist.com/coffee-meets-bagel/coffee-meets-bagel-discover) section. This is a great choice if you spot a person you like who isn’t part of your curated matches and can increase your chances of finding a relationship.

### Reopen a Conversation

Conversations on CMB automatically expire if they’re inactive. If you’re having regrets over letting a conversation go, you can spend Beans to reopen, even after the initial chat window has disappeared.

### Discover

The [Discover](https://coffeemeetsbagel.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020785714-What-is-the-difference-between-Suggested-and-Discover) section on CMB shows you additional Bagels that are outside of your preferences but could still be great matches for you. You can use your Beans to like profiles in this section and show interest in community members outside of your standard matches.

## How to Use Beans

Beans are perfect for accessing Premium features and getting more out of your CMB experience. They can improve your dating strategy and help you get the most out of your dating experience.

### Accessing Premium Features

Beans can give you access to some Premium features including read receipts and activity reports, which can give you insights into your matches.

### Unlocking Additional Bagels

If your daily Suggested Bagels aren’t enough, use the Beans to Like Bagels on the Discover Page.

### Using Beans for ‘Read Receipts’ and ‘Activity Reports’

Beans can be spent on read receipts - these let you know when your messages have been read, which gives you great insights into your chats.[Activity Reports](https://coffeemeetsbagel.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021076213-What-is-included-in-the-Activity-Reports) can be used to get insights into another user’s activities, such as how often they begin chats or respond to communication.

### Other Special Features Unlocked with Beans

You can use Beans to access other special features, such as sending [Flowers](https://coffeemeetsbagel.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/18916334448659-What-s-new) to ensure your Like stands out or Boosting your profile to ensure more people see it.

## How to Earn Free Beans on Coffee Meets Bagel

While you’ll always have the ability to buy Beans, it’s great to have the option to earn free beans without spending any money! In our experience, the best way to get free Beans is by referring friends - there is no limit to how many friends you can refer! You can also earn Beans by following CMB on social media and taking advantage of the bonus Beans when you first sign up.

### Does Coffee Meets Bagel Reward Women with Beans when using the app?

Coffee Meets Bagel doesn’t have any official information that says Bean rewards are different for different genders. However, [anecdotal information](https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeemeetsbagel/comments/oigrtm/wow_cmb_really_rewards_women_for_using_this_app/) suggests women receive more beans per swipe than male users do.

## How Beans Influence the Matchmaking Process

Beans can have a big influence on the matchmaking process, largely through the ability to like Bagels in your Discover. This can extend your pool of possible matches, as you don’t just have to stick to the Bagels provided in your Suggested section.

### Free and Paid Features

CMB has a mixture of free and paid features. While it's definitely possible to use and enjoy the app without using Beans, they can make your matchmaking journey smoother and more likely to end in partnership and a relationship!

When using the free version of CMB, you can still receive daily matches and send messages to these matches. You’ll also get a certain amount of free beans to use.

Beans can be used to access some Premium membership features that improve your online dating experience, such as liking Bagels in Discover, seeing read receipts, and viewing activity reports.

## Key Takeaways

In this article, we’ve looked at:

* What Beans are on CMB
* How to acquire Beans
* How to use Beans
* How to get free Beans
* How Beans can improve your online dating experience

In short, Beans are the in-app currency used in the CMB online dating platform. While you can use the app without Beans, they allow access to premium features, including a wider range of matches from the Discover section and the ability to see read receipts and activity reports.

While you can purchase beans from the Bean Store, you can also earn them for free by engaging with the app on social media, referring friends, and taking advantage of the initial bean bonus available for new users.

Beans are a great way to boost your chances of dating success, as they can expand your pool of possible matches and give you the chance to extend the conversation and rediscover expired chats and connections.

In our view, the most important thing you can do to ensure online dating success is to have a great profile. This doesn’t just mean filling out your profile with your interests, hobbies, age, and gender information, it means that you need to have great photos too! If yours are just not giving what you want them to, try getting in touch with the professional photographers at The Match Artist - they’ll spice up your pictures and have you looking your best.
