## What is Suggested vs. Discover on CMB?

The ‘Suggested and ‘Discover’ features on the Coffee Meets Bagel app are two sections of the platform. Users access these two sections to see other profiles on the app. While the two sections serve similar purposes, they have key differences.

The Suggested section of the Coffee Meets Bagel app is the page you often visit to search for matches. However, the Discover section of the app has untapped potential. This feature can find matches the algorithm may not initially present to you.

## Coffee Meets Bagel Suggested vs. Discover

The main difference between the Suggested and Discover features is the type of profiles you will see in each section. You are far more likely to find someone with mutual interests in the Suggested section rather than the Discover section. That said, browsing the Discover section is still a fantastic way to find connections and increase your number of matches.

## What does "Suggested" Mean on Coffee Meets Bagel?

As the name implies, the Suggested section of the Coffee Meets Bagel app features singles that the algorithm has selected for you. The algorithm chooses these users based on their compatibility with you. Suggested users fit all the filters and preferences you have selected in your profile.

These suggested users are also called ‘bagels’ or potential matches. You browse your bagels before deciding who you want to match with to send a message and start a conversation.

## What does "Discover" Mean on Coffee Meets Bagel?

The Discover section of Coffee Meets Bagel allows you to browse profiles of users that the app has not suggested. Of course, the likelihood of connecting with Suggested users is high. However, many people have found that starting chats with users in the Discover section can lead to finding new friends or partners.

Based on our first-hand experience, the Discover section is a great way to connect with users who may not necessarily fit all of your preferences. These users might not perfectly align with your preferred traits and background. Yet, they may be someone you get along with well, whether platonically or romantically.

## How Does It Work?

Coffee Meets Bagel is a unique dating app that more and more people are turning to to find serious, committed relationships. The only question is: How exactly does this app work?

Let’s check out some key facts that you should know about how the Coffee Meets Bagel app works.

### Potential Matching Process

Every day at noon, the Coffee Meets Bagel app presents you with various potential matches - bagels. This experience differs slightly depending on gender.

Men see 21 possible matches, and women see a curated list of six matches. Both can then either like or pass on each potential match.

If a user taps the heart icon at the bottom of the profile of one of their potential matches, a chat will open up. From here, a user can start exchanging messages.

A user can also send virtual flowers to another user. The flowers feature will make their profile appear at the top of the other users ‘Likes You’ section. This helpful tool can significantly increase the chance of a match.

### Quality Over Quantity

The team of dating experts who run Coffee Meets Bagel prides itself on a ‘quality over quantity’ approach to designing the app. As such, the app limits the number of potential matches it presents you with.

Potential matches are selected for you each day based on your preferences and compatibility. Therefore, you are far more likely to match with someone you will connect with.

### Daily Bagels & Additional Bagels

When presented with your list of potential matches each day, you receive your ‘daily bagels.’ The standard app version only presents 21 bagels to men and six bagels to women per day.

However, you can get more bagels daily by upgrading to a [premium version of the app](https://thematchartist.com/coffee-meets-bagel/coffee-meets-bagel-premium) or purchasing more bagels with ‘beans.’ Beans are the Coffee Meets Bagel in-app currency.

### Premium Preferences Feature

Based on our observations, a great feature of Coffee Meets Bagel Premium is the ability to select exclusive preferences. Selecting these preferences helps the algorithm find better matches for you. The standard version of the app allows you to input your preferences for the following:

* Gender
* Age
* Height
* Distance
* Ethnicity
* Religion

With the premium version of the app, you can also select your preferences for:

* Degrees
* Active within the last 72 hours

Many users upgrade to Coffee Meets Bagel Premium because of exclusive preference filters.

## Special Features & Subscription Options on CMB

Coffee Meets Bagel Premium provides a range of benefits. For example, you can access profile activity reports, which provide key information about another user. You can see details such as the number of times they engage with their matches and how long it typically takes them to respond to messages.

You can also jump the queue with ‘Skip The Line,’ putting you ahead of other users on a potential matches list - other bagels. You can also access message-read receipts to see when other users have viewed your messages.

These features and other bonuses that [boost your account](https://thematchartist.com/coffee-meets-bagel/coffee-meets-bagel-boost) often prompt people to invest in a Coffee Meets Bagel Premium subscription. You can subscribe to the app's premium version for one month, three months, or six months.

## How Much Does Coffee Meets Bagel Cost?

The Coffee Meets Bagel app can be downloaded and used entirely for free. However, there are many ways to spend money to improve your experience. You can purchase more beans or invest in a premium subscription.

A one-month subscription to the app's premium version costs $35. A three-month subscription costs $75 or $25 per month. A six-month subscription costs $120, or $20 per month.

Costs can differ depending on your location, exchange rates, and whether you are purchasing the full or mini version of the premium subscription.

## Key Takeaways

Coffee Meets Bagel is a unique app that helps users form long-term relationships. The app’s helpful recommendations are based on compatibility. What’s more, the app’s easy-to-use interface makes it easy to meet new people.

The users on your Coffee Meets Bagel suggested page will likely be compatible with you. However, a lot of articles and reviews of the app fail to mention the ability to branch out and browse your Discover feed. This section is a fantastic way to make more matches.

If you want more out of the Coffee Meets Bagel app, there are plenty of ways to improve your experience. You can purchase more beans or invest in a premium subscription.

Overall, Coffee Meets Bagel is an easy and effective way to make matches with compatible singles. You can use the Suggested section or the app's Discover section to meet new people.

You could hit it off with someone new, find friends, or meet your soulmate. With a focus on lasting, long-term relationships, Coffee Meets Bagel could be the place you meet your one true love!
