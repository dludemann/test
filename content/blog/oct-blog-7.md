### Why is the First Date Important?

First dates are how two people get to know each other more deeply. First dates help you decide whether or not a relationship would work. If two people do not click on the first date, it is unlikely there will be a second date.

However, a successful first date can often lead to the start of a relationship. Whether you met this person [online](https://thematchartist.com/blog/can-online-dating-lead-to-marriage) or in your [local area](https://thematchartist.com/blog/how-do-i-meet-singles-in-my-area), there’s always a chance you could marry this person!

Because this first experience is so important, you must be yourself! First dates are a chance for your date to truly get to know you. Make sure you make your first memory together a good one!

## Preparing for the First Date

Over time, we found that one crucial aspect of a successful first date is your preparation beforehand. Preparing for a date doesn’t just mean taking a shower and looking good. There are many other aspects that you should prepare before a first date.

### Outfit Ideas

Okay, while looking good isn’t the *only* thing to consider when preparing for a first date, it is important! Ensure you look nice but are also wearing something that reflects your personality.

If you’re a woman who hates wearing dresses, don’t feel pressured to put one on for a first date. If you’re a man who would otherwise never wear a suit, you don’t have to wear one now! Your date wants to know what you are like, including your sense of style.

### Conversation Topics

Conversation topics are another essential tool when preparing for a first date. If you are anxious or struggle to make conversation, preparing topics can help ease your nerves.

Refrain from dull, cliche conversation topics (nobody wants to talk about the weather or their job for an hour). Consider asking your date about what music they like, sports they play, or their greatest ambitions!

### Making Eye Contact

You can never overstate the importance of making eye contact, yet this is something that many people struggle with. Not making eye contact with your date can make you seem overly anxious or uninterested.

You may find it hard to engage your date in conversation without eye contact. In the leadup to your date, try practicing maintaining eye contact. You can do this with friends, family, or even in the mirror.

### Setting the Right Tone and Atmosphere

Do you want this date to be casual and lighthearted? Is the person you are taking out a big lover of fancy dinners? Set an appropriate tone and match the atmosphere of the date to this.

## 11 Best First Date Ideas That Are Actually Good

Based on our observations, the classic ‘dinner and movie’ date works. But it may be cliche and predictable. If you’re looking for unique and fun first date ideas, why not try out one of these?

### Take a Walk

Walking together is an excellent pick for a casual, lighthearted first date. A stroll around a beautiful landscape, whether in the city or countryside, can be a great first date. Conversation tends to flow well during a relaxing walk.

### Visit an Art Gallery

Checking out a local art gallery is a super underrated idea for a first date. These galleries often display some seriously incredible work that you can converse over. Walking around the gallery allows you to get to know your date.

### Swap Hobbies

Try something exciting, like swapping hobbies with your date for a more unique option. Do you love to play tennis, and your date loves to bake? Why not hit the courts for a game before retiring to the kitchen to whip up a batch of cookies?

A lot of successful relationships involve couples sharing hobbies. The sooner you can bond with someone over something they love, the more wonderful memories you can make!

### Check Out a Carnival or Amusement Park

If you and your date are a fun-loving pair, why not visit a carnival or amusement park? This kind of action-packed date can be a fantastic experience and can provide you with lasting memories.

### Go Hiking

For a more adventurous date, you can always go for a hike. You will see amazing sights, get plenty of fresh air, and bond with your date. You could even pack a picnic to enjoy once you reach your destination.

### Get a Spa Treatment

Booking a luxurious spa treatment can be a thoughtful and lovely first date. Nothing is better than rest and relaxation to put your mind at ease and get your energies flowing.

### Go Kayaking

Another outdoor activity date idea is kayaking. Like hiking, this is an excellent choice for the more adventure-inclined. Fresh air, dopamine, and a damn good time - what more do you need to spark things up?

### Make a Meal Together

Making a meal together can be a fun and intimate first date idea. Getting together and whipping up some of your favorite food is perfect for a casual and laid-back first date. Your signature dish can also help spur conversation about your background and preferences.

### Build a Fire

Have you ever seen romantic photos of couples in front of a bonfire at the beach? Building a fire together can be a cozy date idea - especially when paired with wine and food!

### Make a Craft

Another charming yet underrated idea for a first date is crafting. Many establishments offer craft classes or events; you can do this at home for free. Not only will you have a fun first date, but you will also have a memento to reminisce over!

### Shop for Antiques

Shopping for antiques is a slower-paced, cute date idea that can fill a whole day with fun. Grab a bite to eat or a coffee in between shops. Antiquing is excellent if you and your date have an eye for the quaint and beautiful.

## Choosing the Location for the First Date

Based on our first-hand experience, where your first date takes place is fundamental. If you struggle to think of a great location, that’s okay! We’ve got some splendid first date locations for you to check out.

### Coffee Shop or Café

There is a reason why a coffee shop or café is a classic location to have a first date. Not only is there ample opportunity for great conversation, but there are also lots of delicious drinks!

### Ice Cream Parlor or Sweet Shop

Having your first date at an ice cream parlor or sweet shop is a dream come true for a lot of sweet tooths. Consider checking out parlors and shops in your area that would be a good fit for a first date.

### Pottery Class or Cooking Class

A first date that involves using your hands can be an awesome way to alleviate tension or awkwardness. You can always discuss what you are making if there is a lull in the conversation. This informality through shared learning makes first dates at pottery or cooking classes such an outstanding idea.

### Amusement Park or Animal Lovers Zoo/Park/Garden

A first date at an amusement park, zoo, public park, or garden is a nice fairweather choice. With countless things to spark conversation over in these everchanging environments, there’s little chance for awkwardness and silence.

### Mic Night, Comedy Show, Baseball Game, Board Games, Video Games, etc.

If you want something more off the beaten track, many marvelous options are available. If your date likes competition and gaming, why not play video games at home?

Up for a laugh? Try attending a comedy tour or funny open mic night.

Bad weather? Break out your favorite board games in your coziest room at home.

### Perfect Settings for Different Interests and Hobbies

If your date has specific interests and hobbies, tailoring your first date to these hobbies is a great idea. If you share these interests in hobbies, that’s a bonus right from the start.

Visit a bookstore, go bowling, check out a museum, or have a trivia night! Anything that appeals to your date will make the experience all the better.

## First Date Conversation Starters

Drawing from our experience, your first date with someone is your chance to make a great first impression. Dating often relies on good conversation, so having some conversation starters in your back pocket can be a lifesaver.

### Start with the Basics

Starting with the basics about yourself is a good idea at the beginning of the date.

What is your name? How old are you?

Do we have any mutual friends? What do you do for a living?

Getting this essential information out of the way often leads to deeper conversations.

### Talk About Where You are from

Discussing where you are from is generally a great conversation starter. Sharing details about your background allows your date to also speak about theirs. Most of the time, this leads to a range of other topics.

### Delve into Preferences

Delve into your likes and dislikes and discuss your preferences. This will help you gauge how much you have in common with your date and how compatible you are.

### Discuss Your Favorite Movies, TV Shows, and Books

Movies, TV shows, books, and songs are always rich topics of conversation, especially if you share the same opinions. In case the conversation starts to wane, discussing media is a great topic to fall back on.

### Open Up About Your Hobbies

Chatting about hobbies will almost always occur on a first date. Whether you like sports or reading, comparing hobbies can be fun and tell you much about each other.

### Chat About Your Ambitions

Don’t fear vulnerability – your date wants to understand who you are, which requires honesty. Talking about your ambitions will also give you some indication of how compatible your life goals are.

### Talk About Food

A good talking point during a first date is food. If you are both foodies, this topic crops up naturally. Food is a rich avenue of conversation, mainly if the date is at a restaurant.

Frequently Asked Questions

### How Long Should a Good First Date Last?

### What Topics Should Be Avoided on the First Date?

You generally want to keep things light-hearted and fun on a first date. Avoiding dark conversation topics, such as tragedies in the news, is a good idea.
