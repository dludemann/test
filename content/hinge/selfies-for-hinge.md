Hinge Photo Rules
-----------------

Hinge is _all about_ putting your best foot forward, and your photos play a big role in that. 

Fear not, however, because the photo rules are actually pretty simple:

*   **You need at least six photos to create a profile**
    

You can, of course, go over this — and if you [work with The Match Artist](https://thematchartist.com/online-dating-photographer-near-me) you’ll have a plethora of awesome images to work with!

*   **At least one of them needs to show your face clearly**
    

Your [first picture](https://thetab.com/uk/2022/01/14/what-photos-should-i-have-on-hinge-dating-app-profile-tiktok-235616#:~:text=Here's%20what%20every%20single%20one,a%20casual%20pic%20of%20you.) should feature a close up of your face looking straight at the camera and smiling.

*   **Ditch the sunglasses**
    

Survey says: [sunglasses](https://www.ninjaonlinedating.com/blog/sunglasses-in-dating-profile) in bio photos are one of the biggest turn offs for a woman! Don’t give someone the opportunity to say no before you can even say hello!

*   **Recent and accurate photos only**
    

Sorry, no using your high school glamor shot from 10 years ago!

*   **Have a variety of photos on your profile**
    

While Hinge doesn’t ban selfies outright, they do recommend mixing it up to show off different aspects of your personality and interests. So snap away! Just remember to keep it classy! 

If the photos you’re taking yourself are not coming out as you hoped, don’t be afraid to [contact us at the Match Artist](https://thematchartist.com/online-dating-photographer-near-me) for some extra help! 

We love what we do and our professional photographers will work with you over a 4–5 hour shoot to get the most flattering pictures that truly represent who you are, and give you a leg up over the other guys on the app!

Are Selfies Okay for Hinge?
---------------------------

Yes, selfies are totally okay for Hinge! In fact, they can be a great way to show off your personality and give others a glimpse into your daily life. 

That being said, one of our top tips is to mix it up and include a variety of dating photos that show different sides of yourself. This could include a pic with your pet (_a big dating profile yes! Even better if it’s a dog_), doing your favorite activity, or even at the beach or another fave location.

So go ahead and snap a cute selfie! But also throw in some pictures from your camera roll that show you doing something you love, hanging out with friends, or exploring a new place.

There are also some real cliché “trends” you may have seen a lot that you’ll want to avoid in your profile picture, such as having a huge number of topless gym selfies or using too many filters.

_Yikes!_

What Do Selfies Signal on Hinge?
--------------------------------

Selfies on Hinge can signal a few different things, depending on the context. 

On one hand, they can show that you’re confident and comfortable in your own skin, which is definitely a positive trait. They can also be a quick and easy way to show off a new hairstyle, outfit, or accessory (just make sure the styling is on point). 

That being said, anecdotal stories usually lean towards the idea that if all of your images are selfies, you tend towards being more self-absorbed or one-dimensional.

How Many Selfies Should You Have on Hinge?
------------------------------------------

When it comes to selfies on Hinge, the key is balance. Just as your bio shouldn’t be treated like a newsletter, your selfies should be few and far between.

As a general rule of thumb, aim for no more than one or two selfies in your profile. Trust us — that’s more than enough! Fill out the rest of your profile with great photos, instead, and watch the matches come pouring in.

Are Mirror Selfies Okay on Hinge?
---------------------------------

Mirror selfies are a bit of a risk — [research shows only 13%](https://holrmagazine.com/dos-and-donts-of-online-dating-by-hinge/#:~:text=Don't%20Post%20That%20Mirror,clearly%20see%20the%20person's%20face.) of profiles featuring mirror selfies are successful. 

However, if you truly feel that a mirror selfie is the best option for showcasing your looks, go ahead and upload one. The key is to make sure it shows off your personality and style in a positive way. 

That being said, it’s important to avoid mirror selfies as profile photos that are too revealing or come across as too staged. And definitely no bathroom selfies — _no one wants to see that!_ 

Instead, try to take a natural-looking photo that gives potential matches a glimpse into your daily life.

How to Take Good Selfies
------------------------

If you want to take good selfies for Hinge, there are a few things to keep in mind. 

First off, _lighting is key!_ 

Try to take your selfies in natural light, either outside or near a window, to get the most flattering results. 

You’ll also want to play around with your facial expression and angles to find the most flattering look. Don’t be afraid to experiment with different poses and expressions until you find one that works for you. 

If you’re finding your facial expressions are not coming out how you’d like them to, remember that at The Match Artist we offer extensive facial expression coaching that will help you love the way you look in photos!

Don’t forget the background either. You’ll want to ensure that it [isn’t messy](https://www.top10.com/dating/10-tips-on-how-to-take-a-good-dating-profile-photo), as that can distract or take away from your picture. 

Lastly, remember that the most important thing is to be _authentic and true to yourself._ 

So, get creative, have fun, and let your personality shine through in every photo — great photos are only in part about your appearance, _the rest of it is all personality, baby!_

What Are the Best Selfie Angles?
--------------------------------

We all know that taking a selfie is _all about the angle_. But which angle will show you at your best?

The high angle (generally about 45º) has been popular for a while. That’s because the higher the angle, the slimmer (and potentially taller) you appear to be. Some people just don’t look their best when facing the camera straight-on, due to the “flatness” of 2D images.

However, it all depends on _you_, and there’s no real “formula” when it comes to selfie angles.

Ask any Gen-Zer about the “[0.5 selfie](https://www.purewow.com/tech/how-to-take-a-selfie)” (point five) and you’ll find a much higher, wide-lens angle photo, taken with the back of the phone! The desired effect? A much more casual, less posed image.

And, according to popular TikTok photographer [David Suh](https://davidsuhphotography.com/), even a lower-angled image can help show off your best features! 

For example, if you want to highlight your lips, a lower angle will do so. Eyes? A higher angle.

Feel free to experiment and find your best angle!

Does Having Too Many Selfies Make You Look Narcissistic?
--------------------------------------------------------

Despite what you may have heard, though selfie takers may _appear_ to be more narcissistic, it isn’t actually the case.

Don’t believe us? [This 2020 study](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-01343-001) investigated the correlation between narcissism and selfies, across a field pool of 276 college students. 

While even the researchers expected that features of narcissism — in particular grandiose and exhibitionist aspects — would be more prevalent in selfie takers, it wasn’t the case.

Instead, those who had “low level of narcissistic tendencies” still took and posted as many selfies as those on the opposite end of the scale. There was no particularly positive or negative effect, and the researchers concluded that any narcissistic tendencies were likely more a result of “selfie motives” as well as “cultural differences”.

Do Selfies Make You Look Insecure on Hinge?
-------------------------------------------

Selfies don’t necessarily make you look insecure, despite what you may have heard! While some folks might assume that selfies are a sign of low self-esteem, that’s not always the case.

Just be sure to balance everything out, so any potential partners can see that you’re not _just_ “the selfie guy”. You could even make a joke about it on your profile, or use it as a jumping off point for a conversation!

And if you do include a selfie or two in your profile, make sure they’re done tastefully and show off your best side.

Key Takeaways
-------------

Hinge is a great platform to meet women if you’re one of the many singles on the app. However, in addition to paying attention to your bio and crafting perfect conversation starters, you need to make sure that your pics are hitting the right note.

While the occasional selfie is okay, it isn’t the best for showcasing you in the best light, or bringing together everything you are in a single image. It may work on Instagram and other social media, but your Hinge profile isn’t the same.

Our best advice is for you to have a range of photos — focus on the things you love and what you want to portray about yourself, and the rest will fall into place! And don’t forget to pay attention to your lighting, angles, and facial expressions to get the best results.

Remember, confidence is attractive, so _let that be what draws someone else in!_
