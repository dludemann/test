What Are Hinge Standouts?
-------------------------

Hinge Standouts feature designed to make your dating app experience even more enjoyable! 

Every day, Hinge will show you a new selection of users who have answered specific Prompts. From there, you can click on their response to pull up their full profile and, if you’re interested, send a Rose to indicate so.

These recommendations are curated just for you, based on your Likes, interests, [Dealbreakers](https://hingeapp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057625534-What-is-Standouts-), and preferences. It allows you to potentially discover amazing singles who could share your view on the world, making it much easier to find that special someone. 

_And all without having to mindlessly scroll through multiple dating apps!_

Simply tap on the Star icon to access your Standouts feed, and let the magic of the Hinge algorithm work to help you find a match that could lead to a meaningful relationship!

How Are Standouts Chosen on Hinge?
----------------------------------

Standouts on Hinge are handpicked by the app’s algorithm, which takes into account a variety of things to ensure a personalized selection just for you. 

By analyzing both your activity on the app, as well as the information you provide in your profile creation, the algorithm is able to curate a list of Standouts profiles that it deems most likely to pique your interest. 

The Standouts list is not only a reflection of your taste, but also shows you users with high-quality pictures, captivating Prompts, and engaging personalities. 

Hinge’s data-driven approach guarantees that the profiles featured in your Standouts will make your online dating experience both more enjoyable and fruitful!

How Do You Get Selected to Be on Hinge Standouts?
-------------------------------------------------

To increase your chances of being featured in Hinge Standouts, focus on creating an exceptional dating profile that showcases your best qualities. 

Interesting Prompts, genuine answers to questions, and authenticity can make a significant difference in catching the attention of the Hinge algorithm, making it onto someone’s Standouts feed, and forging meaningful connections. 

Additionally, make sure to showcase your personality by highlighting your favorite hobby, sports teams, and more to stand out from the crowd. 

Make sure you choose your Prompts carefully — they’ll be the key to showing yourself in the best light! A response like, “I enjoy a glass of wine from time to time” is pretty basic, so don’t be afraid to be a little silly, if necessary!

The most important thing is to _use Prompts to show off who you are!_

And let’s not forget the all-important high-quality pictures! Out of everything you could do to _really_ increase your chances of getting onto Standouts, having top-quality snaps is our number one recommendation.

If you don’t have the skills or equipment, that’s where [The Match Artist can help](https://thematchartist.com/online-dating-photographer-near-me)!

We specialize in taking photos for your dating profile, as well as facial expression coaching (a must for your images), and _we can get your more dates!_ 

Not sure you believe us? Just [check out what some of our past clients have had to say](https://thematchartist.com/case-studies)!

Improving your photos is not only easy (_all you have to do is look at the camera, while we click the shutter_), it’s also _a must_ if you want to make sure your profile gets noticed!

How Do You Like a Match in the Standout Tab?
--------------------------------------------

Liking a match in the Standout tab is a simple and user-friendly process. 

First, navigate to the Standouts feed by tapping the Star icon located in the app’s bottom menu bar panel. 

Once there, you can browse the curated list of profiles and engage with those that pique your interest. 

Note that you can _only_ Like someone on your Standouts list by sending them a Rose. 

Using Roses on Hinge
--------------------

Roses on Hinge operate in much the same way that Super Likes do on Tinder. While you can send a Rose to any profile, you should bear in mind that:

*   You can only send a Rose to someone in your Standouts feed to indicate that you’re interested
    

*   You only receive one free Rose per week (regardless of whether or not you’re a Hinge Subscriber)
    

*   You can purchase extra Roses within the app (purchasing in bulk makes them slightly cheaper).
    

Once you’ve sent someone a Rose, your profile will move to the top of their Likes You feed, increasing your chances of capturing the other person’s attention.

Hinge (and we) recommend also sending a comment along with your Rose. Not only is it a great way to break the ice, [according to Hinge](https://hingeapp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007906593-Liking-and-Commenting-in-Discover) it could even increase your response rate by up to three times!

To use a Rose when browsing your Standouts feed, simply tap on the Rose icon next to the Heart icon, and watch as your Like blooms into a memorable gesture!

Does Hinge Tell You If You’re on Standouts?
-------------------------------------------

Hinge [does not](https://techzillo.com/am-i-on-hinge-standouts/) directly notify you when your profile is featured on Standouts on someone else’s feed. 

However, if you suddenly start receiving a bunch of Roses and comments, you more than likely have made it onto people’s Standouts feeds!

Keep in mind that the more captivating and genuine your profile appears, the more likely it is to be featured.

Is Using This Feature Worth the Cost?
-------------------------------------

Standouts is a free feature, but with only one free Rose a week, you may find yourself spending a fair amount, especially if you see more than one person who’s just your type on it!

The issue is that the folks you see on your Standouts feed may never make it onto your Discover feed. So, unless you have really good self control and a sixth sense when it comes to knowing who’s likely to match with you, it could all get a little out of hand.

For many users, the value of Standouts lies in its ability to streamline the process of finding potential matches, as well as saving time by curating a list of profiles that align with their preferences. 

If you’re someone who finds the idea of sifting through thousands of profiles daunting, extra Roses could be worth the investment (and, as mentioned, if you buy in bulk, you can get a discount). 

However, if you’re content with the experience provided by the app’s standard features and don’t mind a more hands-on approach to finding matches, then the cost of utilizing Standouts might not be as appealing. 

Ultimately, the decision to invest in the Standouts feature should be based on your unique preferences, goals, and budget when it comes to online dating. 

Personally? We think you’d be better placed using your money to [hire a professional photography service](https://thematchartist.com/online-dating-photographer-near-me), such as The Match Artist, to improve your profile.

Spending on Roses could not only be costly, but also ultimately fruitless, as there’s no guarantee that it’ll lead to anything! 

On the other hand, making sure that you have incredible professional photos could mean that _you’re_ the recipient of more Roses than you can shake a stick at!

Final Thoughts
--------------

Standouts is more than just a showcase of attractive profiles, it’s a carefully curated list of suggestions that considers various factors. These include location, shared hobbies, and compatibility, all which could help you find a genuine connection with someone who shares your interests and values.

Your profile is your virtual window, door, and threshold to potential matches, so it’s important to make sure that your profile is one that a potential match wouldn’t be able to say no to!

Unlike other paid features on dating sites, Standouts is a free tool that could actively guide you towards a meaningful connection, as long as you’ve optimized your profile to begin with!

Remember to:

*   Fully fill out your profile
    

*   Remain open minded and don’t restrict your preferences or Dealbreakers too much
    

*   Use your Roses carefully
    

*   Select your Prompts mindfully, and craft witty, to-the-point, and genuine responses
    

*   Ensure that your profile pictures are great quality and showcase _you!_
    

And, if you don’t feel like your pictures are as good as they could be, and think it’s time to switch things up, [get in touch with The Match Artist](https://thematchartist.com/online-dating-photographer-near-me).

Hinge Standouts FAQs
--------------------

### Does Hinge show most attractive first?

Hinge doesn’t show the dating profiles it deems to be “most attractive” first in your feed. Instead, it has a somewhat more personalized approach, rather than focusing just on your appearance. 

The app’s algorithm prioritizes compatibility based on various factors. This approach ensures that users receive curated feeds of potential matches that are more likely to resonate with them on a deeper level.

Of course, physical attraction is still a part of the equation, but Hinge aims to go beyond surface-level connections.

### Do girls have Roses on Hinge?

Yes, girls have access to Roses, just like men. Every user receives [a free rose every week](https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/roses-on-hinge), regardless of their gender or whether or not they are a Hinge subscriber. Additional Roses can be purchased through the app.

Roses are the only way to let someone on your Standouts feed know that you’re interested, though you can also use them with profiles on your Discover feed.

### How do I manage the post notifications for my Hinge Standouts feed?

You can easily manage post notifications for your Standouts feed by adjusting your app settings. 

To do this:

*   Go to your profile
    

*   Tap the Gear icon (settings)
    

*   Navigate to Notifications
    

*   Toggle notifications for Standouts to “Off”.
    

Turning off the notifications will stop you from receiving updates about new Standouts in your feed, though you will still be able to access the feed in the app.

### What’s the top feature that sets Hinge Standouts apart from other dating app functions?

Standouts is an entirely unique feature to Hinge, and something that other dating apps have not (yet) implemented.

With the app’s ability to showcase a curated selection of users based on your preferences and the information provided in their profiles, this could be a step in the right direction when it comes to meeting women who may be more compatible with you.

Other apps show you lots of options, which can be overwhelming. However, as Hinge’s focus is on real, genuine connections, this approach allows you to shift your attention to a smaller number of potential matches.

### How does the Hinge Standouts feature work, and what is the place of the keywords in the selection process?

Standouts are determined by an algorithm that takes into account various factors such as mutual interests, preferences, and compatibility. 

The keywords you provide — such as hobbies (like reading or watching movies), values, or shared experiences — play a significant role in the selection process. They help the algorithm understand what you’re looking for, and match you with users who have similar interests.

### Can I increase the number of Standouts displayed on my Hinge app?

Unfortunately, you can’t increase how many Standouts are displayed on Hinge. However, you can refresh the selection by swiping through the current Standouts, or waiting for the app to update (it does so daily). 

This allows you to explore new profiles and check for potential new names that may catch your eye.

### Do I need to spend money to access Hinge Standouts?

Standouts is a free feature, available to all Hinge users. 

However, if you want to increase your chances of making a meaningful connection, you could consider purchasing extra Roses, or upgrading your account to either Hinge+ or HingeX. 

Upgrading unlocks additional features, such as the ability to send unlimited Likes, Boosts, advanced preferences, and the ability to see who has already Liked you.
