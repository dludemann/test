<p>Let’s get started!</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<h2 id="what-is-hinge">What Is Hinge?</h2>
<p><a href="https://hinge.co/">Hinge</a> was launched in 2012 (incidentally, the same year Tinder was launched), and is owned by the Match Group. Similar in usability to Tinder or Bumble, Hinge is a popular dating app used by people in many countries around the world. </p>
<p></p>
<p>However, unlike Tinder and Bumble, Hinge promotes itself as “the app designed to be deleted”. Its aim is to help people find each other and form genuine relationships instead of casual hookups.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hinge has additional features on the app which lets users showcase their personality. This includes Hinge Prompts — Hinge’s answer to a traditional bio — as well as snapshots of information, for example Dealbreakers, and a minimum of six profile photos.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Functionality on Hinge is quite different to other dating apps, and designed to make you slow down and really consider the information in front of you. Rather than liking the profile as a whole, you like (or heart) specific aspects of another person’s profile — this could be pictures, Prompt response posts or videos, or otherwise. </p>
<p></p>
<p>You can also send a comment along with your like, which Hinge claims will increase your likelihood of receiving a response by <a href="https://hingeapp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011232853-How-do-I-comment-on-someone-s-profile-">three times</a>!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once you’ve shown interest in the other person, they’ll then get a notification and can choose to match with you. That will then move you both into a private chat room, where you can get to know one another!</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can download Hinge to your device from the Apple (for iPhones) or Google Play  (for Android) stores.</p>
<h3>What Is Hinge For?</h3>
<p>Hinge aims to facilitate meaningful connections between users looking for more than just a fleeting encounter. It provides a platform where men and women can create detailed profiles, including criteria such as age, gender, and dealbreakers. And all from their phone screens in the comfort of their homes!</p>
<p></p>
<p>The information provided is then run through the algorithm to provide matches that align with your preferences. Hinge users can use the platform to find potential partners, ranging from dates, to long-term relationships, love, and even marriage.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hinge is designed to be used on your mobile device, so currently there’s no desktop site version available.</p>
<h3>Are Most People on Hinge Real?</h3>
<p>Yes, most profiles on Hinge are genuine! The app requires users to <a href="https://hingeapp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011050094-How-do-I-create-a-Hinge-account-">verify</a> their account with a phone number, and encourages them to link their account to social media, such as Facebook or Instagram. This weeds out fake profiles, proving security and safety for users. </p>
<p></p>
<p>You should still exercise caution though — it is possible for fake profiles to slip through, even with Hinge’s policies in place. Make sure you mind your privacy and safety until you’re sure you can trust someone. </p>
<h2 id="hinge’s-functionality-and-algorithm">Hinge’s Functionality and Algorithm</h2>
<p>Hinge stands out among dating apps due to its well-thought-out algorithm. It combines the power of technology with the personal touch of user preferences and data. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The profile icon on your phone will represent a gateway to countless potential connections, driven by an algorithm that aims to help you find happiness and contentment in your dating life!</p>
<h3>Does Hinge Actually Work?</h3>
<p>The short answer is, yes! Thanks to its unique approach that allows users to go beyond the surface of shallow encounters, Hinge has seen numerous <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hingeapp/comments/uxlbem/another_hinge_success_story_be_patient">successful matches leading to dates and relationships</a>. The app considers age, preferences and answers to profile questions to help make matches. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Nothing is guaranteed, however — you need to make sure you put effort into your profile! </p>
<p></p>
<p>An easy way to improve your chances at getting more matches on Hinge is to make sure you’ve optimized your profile. That includes upgrading your profile pics.</p>

<h3>How Does The Hinge Algorithm Work?</h3>
<p>The Hinge <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Hinge-Algorithm#:~:text=Hinge's%20algorithm%2C%20which%20is%20based,you%20better%20matches%20over%20time.">algorithm</a> uses a variety of factors to suggest potential matches. It takes into account the information you provide when you fill out your profile, including:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your age</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gender</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Location</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dealbreakers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your responses to various questions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>It also learns from your actions on the app, such as your likes, the messages you send and the connections you make. </p>
<p></p>
<p>This way it manages to foster a sense of community, unity, warmth, and togetherness among its users. </p>
<h2 id="understanding-location-on-hinge">Understanding Location on Hinge</h2>
<p>Hinge differs from Tinder and other dating apps in that it <a href="https://cybernews.com/how-to-use-vpn/change-location-on-hinge/#:~:text=As%20we've%20mentioned%20previously,you%20matches%20in%20that%20area.">doesn’t use location data</a> automatically. Instead, you set your location yourself, which enables you to find potential partners in your corner of the world. </p>
<h3>Is Hinge a Location-Based App, like Tinder?</h3>
<p>Yes, Hinge is location based, but with a difference. Instead of using GPS data from your phone, Hinge allows you to set your location manually. </p>
<h3>Does Hinge Automatically Update Your Location?</h3>
<p>Hinge lets users set their location manually in their profiles, which means it won’t automatically update. </p>
<p></p>
<p>If you live in New York and move to Boston, you’ll have to change your location setting if you want to start getting matches in your new area.</p>
<h3>Why Does Hinge Location Keep Changing?</h3>
<p>Your Hinge location shouldn’t keep changing, as it doesn’t update automatically. If you notice your location is changing, it might be due to a glitch in the app, so you’ll need to contact Hinge’s support team for help. </p>
<h3>Why Does Hinge Match Me with People Who Are Far Away?</h3>
<p>Hinge could match you with people far away due to the location settings in your profile. Sometimes if you’ve set a wide search area, Hinge may show you matches from farther areas to increase potential connections.</p>
<h3>How Far is Hinge Location?</h3>
<p>You can choose your location radius in the Hinge app. Of course, the maximum distance is really up to you, but the smallest area you can set your preferences to is 10 miles. This is because Hinge aims to be a relationship app rather than a hookup app. </p>
<h2 id="adjusting-location-settings-on-hinge">Adjusting Location Settings on Hinge</h2>
<p>You can adjust your location settings on Hinge if you move, if you’re away traveling and want to meet people, or if you want to expand or contract your location radius.</p>
<h3>How to Change Location On Hinge Manually</h3>
<p>Changing your location on Hinge is super easy! Just follow this list of steps:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Launch your Hinge app and sign in</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Proceed to the “Settings” section</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Choose the “Preferences” option</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Select “My Neighborhood”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tap on the compass icon, or use the pinch and zoom feature until you pinpoint your desired location.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to Update Hinge Location Automatically</h3>
<p>Hinge doesn’t update location automatically, the reason being it doesn’t connect to GPS. Instead, you’ll need to change your location manually, as described above. </p>
<h3>Update Hinge Location Automatically on iOS</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, iOS doesn’t have an option to automatically update Hinge location, nor does Android — the only way to change your location is to do it manually. </p>
<h3>Do I Need a VPN to Change My Hinge Location?</h3>
<p>You don’t need to use a VPN to change your Hinge location, you just need to go into your location settings and do it manually. </p>
<h2 id="consequences-and-considerations-of-changing-hinge-location">Consequences and Considerations of Changing Hinge Location</h2>
<p>We’ve established that it’s possible to change your Hinge location, but does it have any consequences? Here’s everything you should consider.</p>
<h3>Do You Lose Hinge Matches if You Change Location?</h3>
<p>Unlike other dating apps, matches on Hinge <a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/p/when-do-your-hinge-matches-expire-heres-how-long-you-have-to-flirt-15915761#:~:text=If%20you're%20wondering%20when,at%20Hinge%2C%20tells%20Elite%20Daily.">never expire</a> (unless you unmatch the user). So, rest easy — you won’t lose your matches if you change your location! </p>
<h3>Can You Fake Your Location on Hinge?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can fake your location on Hinge, but why would you want to? </p>
<p></p>
<p>You can set your Hinge location to anywhere you want, but it makes most sense to set it as your actual location so you can meet people in your area. It isn’t a good idea to give a fake location, any more than it would be to give a fake name.</p>
<h3>Why Do You Need to Change Location on Hinge?</h3>
<p>You might need to change your location on Hinge if you move cities, if you’re away traveling for a long period of time, or if you realize your current location settings are incorrect.</p>
<h2 id="geographical-use-of-hinge">Geographical Use of Hinge</h2>
<p>Hinge is used in many countries around the world, but where is it most popular? We’ve done the research for you!</p>
<h3>What City Uses Hinge the Most?</h3>
<p>There isn’t any concrete data on which cities use Hinge the most, but user experience seems to suggest that the app works best when used in larger cities. </p>
<p></p>
<p>One <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hingeapp/comments/pw0t00/is_hinge_only_good_in_big_tech_cities/">Reddit</a> user shared his experience that the app works better for users in larger cities like New York and LA, especially when compared to smaller and mid-sized cities. </p>
<h3>What Countries Use Hinge the Most</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://blog.gitnux.com/hinge-user-statistics/#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20was%20the,%25%20and%206.67%25%2C%20respectively.">surveys</a>, the United States was by far the top country of users on Hinge in Jan 2023, making up 47.69% of users. This was followed by the UK and Canada at 7.57% and 6.67%.</p>
<h3>Where Should I Set My Hinge Location</h3>
<p>Things will go best for you if you set your location to where you spend the most time, so you can find matches in your local area. </p>
<h2 id="hinge-hometown-vs-location">Hinge Hometown vs. Location</h2>
<p>Is there a difference between your Hinge hometown and your Hinge location? We’ll break down the differences and what they mean!</p>
<h3>Hinge Hometown Meaning</h3>
<p>Your hometown on your Hinge profile is different from your location. Although there is some confusion, this Reddit thread confirms your hometown is so you can share information about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hingeapp/comments/s8zo41/question_about_the_hometown_in_the_profile/">where you’re from and where you grew up</a> with potential matches. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Think of it as just another piece of information about you for your bio! If you still live in the same city you grew up in, then your hometown will be the same as your location. </p>
<h3>Hinge Hometown vs. Location for Females</h3>
<p>For your Hinge hometown, fill in where you grew up when you’re filling out your profile. </p>
<p></p>
<p>When setting your location, choose the area that you currently live in, and set the maximum distance to something that suits you. </p>
<h3>Hinge Hometown vs. Location for Guys</h3>
<p>There really isn’t any difference between Hinge hometown vs. location for guys or girls! Just put down your hometown as the town you grew up in, and your location as the place you live in. </p>
<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>Hinge is a dating app that focuses on fostering meaningful connections rather than facilitating hookups. Because of this, it won’t automatically change your location when you’re traveling, but will keep showing you matches based on where your location is set to. </p>
<p></p>
<p>If you want to change your location because you are in a different city or you have moved, you can do it manually in your profile settings. If your goal is to find a long-term relationship, it is best to keep your location settings to where you spend most of your time, so you can find a relationship with anyone in your area. </p>
<p></p>
<p>If you find that you’re not getting as many matches as you’d like, you can try expanding your maximum distance, or improve your profile. This includes making sure you’ve shared as many details as possible (within reason — <em>don’t go giving out your social security number or passwords!</em>) about your life, your friends, your family, and the things you care about.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another surefire way to improve your profile is to make sure your pictures are the best they can be by <a href="https://thematchartist.com/online-dating-photographer-near-me">getting in touch with The Match Artist</a>!
