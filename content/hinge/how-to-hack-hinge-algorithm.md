When it comes to finding love on the internet, with so many users and profiles to sort through on so many different dating apps, it can be challenging to get noticed. 

Well, that’s the reason the Hinge algorithm exists — it’s designed to show you the most compatible profiles based on your preferences and the comments you leave on the app.

But how exactly can you make the algorithm _work best for you_ to get you more matches and dates?

In this article we’ll cover:

*   How the Hinge algorithm works
    

*   Whether or not you can trick it
    

*   Our top 6 tips for how to “hack” the algorithm
    

*   Frequently asked questions.
    

From optimizing your profile and preferences, to engaging with other users and understanding the app’s features, we’ve got you covered. Let’s get into it!

  
  

How does the Hinge Dating Algorithm Work?
-----------------------------------------

The Hinge dating algorithm uses a combination of factors to match users with their most compatible profiles. These factors include user preferences, such as age range, location, and height (all of which you can define in your settings).  

The algorithm also takes into account user behavior on the app, such as which profiles they Like or pass on, and how often they engage with the app.

The algorithm uses both machine learning and artificial intelligence to analyze user data, then makes predictions about what kind of profiles they are most likely to be interested in. 

To improve the accuracy of the matches, Hinge also uses prompts and questions to help users showcase their personalities and preferences. 

The more detailed and authentic your profile, the better the algorithm can match you with others who share similar interests and values.

### Is Hinge based on The Gale-Shapley Algorithm?

The Hinge algorithm is not explicitly based on the [Gale-Shapley Algorithm](https://towardsdatascience.com/gale-shapley-algorithm-simply-explained-caa344e643c2), also known as the Stable Marriage Algorithm, which is used in economics to match individuals based on their preferences. 

However, there are similarities between the two — both use a ranking system to match individuals with the most compatible partners. 

In the case of Hinge, the algorithm uses user preferences and behavior on the app to make predictions about which profiles are most likely to be a good match. This includes analyzing factors such as age, location, height, hobbies, interests, and other details filled out in the profile. 

The algorithm then ranks the profiles based on their compatibility with the user’s preferences and shows them to the user in order from top to bottom.

### The Future of the Hinge Algorithm

Hinge has been working to improve its algorithm since the early days of the app. 

Back in 2018, it employed [machine learning](https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/hinge-a-data-driven-matchmaker) in order to better match users to “optimal dates”, and according to the [Harvard Data Science Review](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/i4eb4e8b/download/pdf#:~:text=At%20Hinge%2C%20the%20Gale%2D%20Shapley,of%20college%20admissions%2C%20marriage)), the developers are now working on how geolocation data will be able to provide them with information about your IRL dates!

Rather than this being an invasion of your privacy, it shows how algorithms will eventually be able to move beyond just matchmaking. Instead, they’ll be a large part of how dating apps are able to create both safer and fairer online dating experiences.

Can You Trick the Hinge Algorithm?
----------------------------------

Sadly, there is no foolproof way to trick the Hinge algorithm! However, there are some strategies that daters can use to improve their chances of getting matches. 

One approach is to optimize your profile to make it as attractive and authentic as possible, highlighting your likes, interests, and personal style. 

This can include choosing the right photos (_incredibly important!_), filling out the profile with detailed information, and using the app’s filters and prompts to showcase your personality. 

Another strategy is to use the app frequently and engage with other users by liking and commenting on their profiles. This can increase your visibility on the app and improve your chances of getting matches. 

However, it’s important to note that trying to game the algorithm by using dishonest tactics such as lying about your preferences or interests is not recommended, as it can lead to negative feedback and damage your chances of finding a meaningful relationship on the app.

After all, _isn’t that the whole point why you’re on it?_

Tips For Hacking the Hinge Algorithm
------------------------------------

### 1\. Be Strategic with Your Profile Photos

Your Hinge profile photos are _crucial_ to attracting potential dates.

While the app is a lot more geared towards showcasing your personality, you can’t deny that _first impressions matter!_ Make sure to showcase your top interests and personal style in your photos, and include a mix of solo shots and group photos to give others an idea of your social life.

We also highly recommend a good headshot as your leading Hinge image (and so do [professional dating coaches and matchmakers](https://www.businessinsider.com/your-dating-profile-should-include-only-these-4-photos-2017-9), according to multiple articles). Try to look directly into the camera and smile, and don’t forget to smarten up your attire a little!

If you include group pictures that include your family members, [make sure you identify them](https://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/ct-online-dating-profile-pictures-advice-20180112-story.html) in the photo captions! While family photos can be a great way to show that you value quality time with your loved ones, you don’t want a potential match to accidentally mistake your sister for your girlfriend!

_Yikes!_

If the pictures you have are just not _giving_ what you want them to, [try getting in touch with The Match Artist](https://thematchartist.com/online-dating-photographer-near-me)!

When you book a shoot with us, you’ll work with a personal photographer for around 4–5 hours in a location of your choice (usually at your home). They’ll spend that time getting every shot possible, and also move around a bit, with some nice outdoor shots towards the end of the day (weather permitting).

The key is for you to appear relaxed, confident, and comfortable, as well as doing the things you love. That really shines through in images, and can be the difference between you getting a date on Hinge or not!

And don’t worry if you’re not much of a natural model — we’ll coach you on everything from facial expression to body language ahead of time, so on shoot day all you’ll have to do is show up!

### 2\. Choose Your Prompts Carefully

Hinge prompts are a great way to showcase your personality and interests, but they can also be a powerful tool for getting more matches. 

Choose prompts that are unique and attention-grabbing, and don’t be afraid to get creative with your answers. 

Remember, the goal is to stand out from the crowd and catch a woman’s eye!

### 3.  Be Open Minded About Your Matches

When it comes to online dating, it’s important to keep an open mind and be willing to explore new connections. 

Don’t be too strict with your preferences or expectations, and take the time to get to know someone before deciding whether or not to pursue a relationship. 

_You never know who you might meet!_

### 4\. Take Advantage of Hinge’s Roses Feature

Hinge’s [Roses](https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/roses-on-hinge) feature allows you to send a special notification to someone you’re really interested in. This can be a great way to catch someone’s attention and make a memorable impression. 

However, use the feature wisely and sparingly, as you’ll only get _one free Rose a week!_

While you can purchase more, sending a bunch of Roses could come across as pushy or desperate. 

_Remember, you’re not on an episode of The Bachelor!_

### 5.  Say No to All the People in Your Standout Feed

Hinge’s Standouts feature is designed to showcase potential matches who have already expressed interest in you. 

While it may be tempting to Like everyone in your Standout feed, it’s important to be selective and only pursue connections that feel genuinely compatible.

Don’t try to game the system with Hinge — it’s not why you’re on it, and it’s likely to confuse the algorithm. 

### 6\. Fill Out Every Section of Your Hinge Profile

To maximize your chances of getting matches on Hinge, it’s important to [fill out every section of your profile](https://medium.com/@dateaha/filling-out-your-online-dating-profile-10-best-tips-to-let-your-story-shine-2e572728494b) in detail. 

This includes your basic information like age and location, as well as your interests, hobbies, and preferences. The more information you provide, the easier it will be for others to get a sense of who you are and what you’re looking for. 

Not to mention that leaving sections blank makes it look like you’re hiding something — or that you’re not taking dating seriously!

It may take a bit of tapping away on your phone to fill out all of the sections, but doing so will guarantee you a better chance at meeting someone special!

### 7\. Change Your App Matching Distance to 1 Mile + Set Age Range to a Very Narrow Range

Since the Hinge algorithm tries to show you profiles that would be most compatible with you (based on factors such as your activity on the app, and information you’ve given it), sometimes that may result in a smaller pool of users. And, let’s face it — the machine could still get it wrong!

One trick which could get you seeing a few more potential matches is to [fiddle with your settings](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwipeHelper/comments/n9o7m6/comment/iq1k9r0) by reducing your matching distance to just 1 mile, then setting your age range very narrowly (say, with only a year’s gap).

Since the app still needs to show you matches, chances are you’ll see people within this very small pool who you may not have seen before!

Just bear in mind that this trick will _also_ decrease the amount of users who will be able to see _your_ profile, which could affect how many Likes you receive.

Final Thoughts
--------------

Let’s be real: sometimes figuring out how to hack a dating app algorithm feels like you’re trying to crack a safe code. And the Hinge algorithm is a complex system that utilizes algorithms and software to provide its users with recommendations based on their app usage and engagement. 

However, while there may be no big hack to guarantee you more dates, we can tell you that the most success you’ll see will be down to you being genuine. In addition, make sure you fill out every section of your profile, and don’t be tempted to tell any lies in your Prompts!

It is also crucial to be open-minded about your matches, and not limit your options based on things like fashion, politics, religion, or wardrobe choices. 

Ultimately, while the algorithm can be a helpful tool in finding someone special, it is up to each individual to put in the effort to make meaningful connections and build a strong network of potential dates. 

And of course, _pay attention to your photos!_
